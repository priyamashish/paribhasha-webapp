      "source": "The jñāpaka (indicator) of the aśabda-saṃjñā portion is the exclusion of roots having the dhā form by the sūtra svarād upasargād dasti kityadhaḥ (4.4.9). If only the dā form were accepted through svam rūpam śabdasya, there would be no context for excluding dhā. Hence, the phrase aśabda-saṃjñā justifies the exclusion of dhā roots, validating the need for the sūtra. According to the paribhāṣā dhātavo’nekārthāḥ (N 2.1.1), roots can convey meanings beyond those found in the dhātupāṭha. Hemahansagaṇi reinforces this with derivational cases like khyāṅk and its substitute cakṣ, both of which receive the ḍa suffix because khyā is not a saṃjñā term. Without this nyāya, only the primary (svābhāvika) or only the substituted (kṛtrima) root would be eligible, depending on which logical nyāya (e.g. gauṇa-mukhyayoḥ or kṛtrimākṛtrimayoḥ) one followed. Nandighoṣa Vijay strengthens the source argument by citing plural usage in nadībhiḥ nāmni (3.1.27) as the jñāpaka for extending operation beyond singular nadī to river names like gaṅgā and yamunā. He further argues that this extension through form, not synonymy, aligns with the restriction laid out by the nyāya.",
      "historicity": "This nyāya has its origin in the Aṣṭādhyāyī as a sūtra. Since it already exists in sūtra form, it is not listed in paribhāṣā collections of the Pāṇinian tradition. It appears as a nyāya for the first time in Durgasiṃha’s Paribhāṣāvṛtti of the Kātantra school. Bhāvamiśra, also of Kātantra, does not include it. Patañjali, in his Mahābhāṣya, clearly rejects the expansive application of this nyāya. Nāgeśa too follows Patañjali’s approach. Outside of Durgasiṃha’s vṛtti, this maxim appears in Bhoja’s grammar. The Nyāyasaṅgraha commentary by Hemahansagaṇi expands its application in the Haima tradition by integrating it with other logical rules and handling exceptions via anityatā. Meanwhile, Nandighoṣa Vijay’s Hindi commentary, while respecting the original formulation, explicitly critiques Hemahansagaṇi’s extension of anityatā to both parts, accepting only the second part as non-permanent and defending the universality of the first.",
      "observation": "The Mahābhāṣya treats this paribhāṣā as a strict principle—only the own form of the word ( śabda-svarūpa ) is accepted for grammatical operation. Patañjali establishes that grammar must exclude all meaning-based derivation and accept only what the phonetic form directly entails. This view is consistent and non-negotiable in his system. Hemahansagaṇi, in contrast, admits that the rule is not universally valid. He distinguishes between cases where the form is shared by multiple roots across gaṇas (e.g., yuj in rudhādi and curādi) and highlights derivational rules (e.g. optional ṇic) that create contextual exceptions. He labels both parts— svam rūpam śabdasya and aśabda-saṃjñā —as anitya (non-permanent). Nandighoṣa challenges this conclusion, arguing that in some cases both kliśyati and kliśnāti are derivationally valid even without plural markers, making the claim of anityatā redundant. He accepts the second part’s non-permanence but asserts the first part should be nitya unless contradicted explicitly. He also reinforces his stance with examples such as kalyagnireyaṇ, arguing that meaning cannot be substituted even when synonyms are present. The disagreement between Hemahansagaṇi and Nandighoṣa hinges on the value of the jñāpaka and the consistency of its application—whether its role is merely illustrative or systemically normative.",
      "conclusion": "This nyāya, though codified as a sūtra in the Pāṇinian system, is interpreted in divergent ways across traditions. Patañjali sets a boundary: grammar is to operate only on form, not meaning, and rules must not cross into semantics. Hemahansagaṇi adapts this principle flexibly, invoking logical nyāyas to resolve derivational ambiguity and arguing for the anityatā of both parts. Nandighoṣa Vijay, offering a counterbalancing voice, preserves the doctrinal rigidity of the first part and contests the necessity of labeling it anitya, thus defending a more conservative grammatical hermeneutic. This rich interpretive tension reflects the depth of śāstric inquiry and the dynamism of vyākaraṇa discourse across schools.",
      "Meaning and Application": "The words used in the rules of vyākaraṇa represent the verbatim sequence of the letters and not their underlying meaning—except for technical terms that represent the meaning rather than the sequence. Just as in the example pañcānām nadīnām samāhāraḥ pañcanadam, the word nadī joins with pañcana to form the avyayībhāva compound pañcanadam. Similarly, by the sūtra saṅkhyā samāhāre (H 3.1.28), particular names of rivers form avyayībhāva compounds such as dviyamunam, trigaṅgā, and saptagodāvaram. Further, by saṅkhyayā nadīgodāvarībhyām (7.3.9), the suffix at is enjoined; then, by klībe (2.4.97), hrasva is substituted; and finally, amavyayībhāvasya ato’pañcamyāḥ (3.2.2) brings in the suffix am at the end. This nyāya expresses two rules and is thus divisible into two parts: svaṃ rūpaṃ śabdasya and aśabda-saṃjñā. The purpose of this maxim is the exclusion of synonyms when applying a rule based solely on the form of the words mentioned in a sūtra. This formulation reflects the restriction advocated in Patañjali’s Mahābhāṣya, where grammatical operations are confined to the śabda-svarūpa (phonetic form) and not its meaning (artha), unless a saṃjñā is explicitly assigned."

      "source": "The existence of vṛddhi substitutions mandated by the sūtras susaṛvārddhādrāṣṭrasya and amadrasya diśaḥ constitutes the jñāpaka (indicatory basis) for this paribhāṣā. If these sūtras were not operating in such compound contexts, their inclusion would be otiose. Thus, these sūtras presuppose the viability of adding suffixes like akañ even when the janapada name is preceded by a prefix like su or sarva, directly contradicting the otherwise prohibitive grahaṇavatānāmnāṃ na tadantavidhiḥ. The presence of n̆it or ṇit markers in these contexts ensures that suffixation proceeds without obstruction. The paribhāṣā thereby affirms the validity of suffix operations in these prefixed forms. Moreover, both this paribhāṣā and the next—ṛtorvṛddhimadvidhāvavayavānām—are considered nitya (obligatory and universally valid) in nature within the Haima system.",
      "historicity": "This nyāya traces its origin to a vārttika of Kātyāyana and is elaborated in Patañjali’s Mahābhāṣya under the Pāṇinian sūtra P 1.1.49 yena vidhi tadantasya. There, Patañjali discusses the limits of applying a rule to internal components of a compound (tadanta) when that component shares grammatical attributes such as endings or affixes. Patañjali explicitly refutes the blanket extension of such operations, citing potential distortions in compounds. However, in discussing exceptions like suṣaṛvārddhadikśabda-janapada compounds, he notes that prakṛti-based extension is permissible where supported by ācāryapravṛtti and functional requirements. Thus, this paribhāṣā emerges historically as an exception to the vārttika samāsapratyayavidhau pratiṣedhaḥ, which otherwise restricts such derivational processes. The paribhāṣā appears in the Jainendra Paribhāṣā-vṛtti (ed. Abhyankar) and in Bhoja’s compilation of grammatical rules, attesting to its inter-school acceptance beyond the Haima framework. Nāgeśa further clarifies that the grahaṇavatānāmnāṃ na tadantavidhiḥ rule is simply a generalized extension of the earlier vārttika and must yield in the face of explicitly codified exceptions such as the present one.",
      "observation": "This nyāya is framed to directly override the restrictive grahaṇavatā rule. The derivations such as sumāgdhikaḥ, sarvamāgdhikaḥ, and pūrvamāgdhikaḥ validate the need for a special rule that permits suffixation and internal operations in prefixed janapada-compounds. The Mahābhāṣya, under P 1.1.49 yena vidhi tadantasya, investigates in great detail the structural implications of applying operations based on internal components. Patañjali outlines possible disruptions—such as in cases of jan, yac, or niṣṭha affixes—when tadanta principles are too broadly applied. However, he also concedes that in some environments, especially where teacher-practice (ācāryapravṛtti) and systemic regularity demand it, such exceptions are acceptable. Hemahansagaṇi in his Sanskrit commentary asserts this as a nitya-paribhāṣā—its application is not optional but structural. He explains that without accepting this paribhāṣā, rules like bahuviṣayebhyaḥ would be rendered inapplicable in sumagadha type cases. Thus, the logical coherence of the Haima system would collapse without this override. Nandighoṣa Vijay in his Hindi commentary reaffirms the derivational necessity of the rule but emphasizes the balance it maintains within the exception framework. He underscores that this is not a generic override but a carefully delimited exception to the more general grahaṇavatā restriction. He also points out that examples like pūrvamāgdhikaḥ would not be derivable without this paribhāṣā, thereby highlighting its essentiality.",
      "conclusion": "The paribhāṣā susaṛvārddhadikśabdebhyo janapadasya plays a pivotal role in safeguarding the derivational logic of the Haima grammatical system. It reconciles the necessity of prefixal modifiers (su, sarva, ardha, dikśabda) with suffixational rules governing janapada names. Historically rooted in the Mahābhāṣya’s discussion of yena vidhi tadantasya, and systemically vital against the background of grahaṇavatānāmnāṃ na tadantavidhiḥ, this paribhāṣā marks a structural exception recognized by multiple traditions. The divergent treatments across Mahābhāṣya, Hemahansagaṇi’s Sanskrit gloss, and Nandighoṣa Vijay’s Hindi elucidation reveal not a contradiction but a spectrum of interpretive commitment to maintaining systemic integrity while allowing functional derivational flexibility.",
      "Meaning and Application": "This paribhāṣā asserts that grammatical operations applicable to names denoting janapada (geographical or political regions) extend equally to compounds prefixed by su, sarva, ardha, and directional terms (dikśabda) when these prefixes precede a janapada-name. This rule operates as an exception to the otherwise binding grahaṇavatānāmnāṃ na tadantavidhiḥ principle, which generally prohibits the application of a rule based on internal members of a compound unless explicitly captured. For example, in magadheṣu bhavaḥ māgdhikaḥ, the suffix akañ is added due to the word magadha denoting a janapada. This logic extends analogically to sumagadheṣu, sarvamagadheṣu, ardhamagadheṣu, and pūrvamagadheṣu, resulting in forms like sumāgdhikaḥ, sarvamāgdhikaḥ, ardhamāgdhikaḥ, and pūrvamāgdhikaḥ by rule bahuviṣayebhyaḥ (H 6.3.45). The initial prefixes—su, sarva, ardha, and pūrva—are operative only when preceding the janapada term, hence the paribhāṣā specifies such configurations. This nyāya also enables the vṛddhi substitution in the initial vowel of the janapada-word, by rules such as susaṛvārddhādrāṣṭrasya and amadrasya diśaḥ (H 7.4.15–16). This vṛddhi occurs only when the janapada word is preceded by the specific prefixes mentioned. In contrast, when ṛddhemagadheṣu bhavaḥ ārddhamāgadhaḥ is formed using bhave (H 6.3.123), the akañ suffix is blocked, and no tadantavidhi applies due to the overriding paribhāṣā."

      "source": "The jñāpaka of this paribhāṣā is the substitution of vṛddhi governed by aṁśādṛtoḥ (H. 7.4.14). This sūtra states that if the anterior part denotes an aṁśa (constituent) and the latter part denotes ṛtu, then vṛddhi substitution occurs at the first vowel of the latter part. But this applies only when ñit-ṇit suffixes are prescribed by varṣākālebhyaḥ (6.3.80) and bhartusandhyāderaṇ (6.3.89). If “grahaṇavatā nāmnā na tadantavidhiḥ” paribhāṣā had prohibited suffixation of ñit-ṇit in words ending in ṛtu (such as pūrvavarṣā), then aṁśādṛtoḥ (H. 7.4.14) would become void. Therefore, it is established that ñit-ṇit can be applied to ṛtu-ending words with avayava-prefixes, thereby negating the restriction posed by grahaṇavatā nāmnā na tadantavidhiḥ. Hence, this nyāya affirms the suffixation even to ṛtvantavācaka words with avayavavācaka purvapada.",
      "historicity": "This nyāya is attested as a vārttika in the Haima tradition. Other paribhāṣākāras do not mention it. Patañjali in the Mahābhāṣya discusses this nyāya only in relation to its exception-status to samāsapratyayavidhau pratiṣedhaḥ. Hemahansagaṇi, however, expands the scope significantly: he argues that if the suffix ñit-ṇit is denied from being affixed to ṛtvantavācaka words with avayavavācaka purvapada, then the Haima sūtra aṁśādṛtoḥ would become useless. Thus, the paribhāṣā validates this application by overriding the restriction. Nandighoṣa Vijay’s Hindi commentary critiques Hemahansagaṇi’s interpretation, particularly his assumption that pūrva denotes avayava. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri supports this criticism, pointing out that in karmadhāraya compounds like pūrvavarṣa, pūrva simply denotes precedence or association—not a true constituent. Thus, he concludes that suffixation should not proceed from such usage, and aṁśādṛtoḥ becomes inapplicable. Yet, Hemahansagaṇi counters this by citing Siddhahema-vṛtti itself, which uses pūrvavarṣa to explain the applicability of ikaṇ in such contexts.",
      "observation": "This paribhāṣā demonstrates the inherent tension between the principles of tadantavidhi and its negation. Its inclusion is to preserve the functionality of sūtra aṁśādṛtoḥ. As such, it highlights the dynamic adaptation of derivational rules in specific contexts. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri’s objections are grounded in a stricter semantic reading of avayava, whereas Hemahansagaṇi and the Siddhahema-vṛtti show greater flexibility in interpreting compound semantics. Ultimately, the paribhāṣā ensures that ṛtu-ending compounds formed with avayavavācaka purvapadas retain access to vṛddhimad suffixes despite grahaṇavatā nāmnā restriction.",
      "conclusion": "The paribhāṣā ṛtoḥ vṛddhimadvidhāv avayavebhyaḥ is a significant exception to the general restriction posed by grahaṇavatā nāmnā na tadantavidhiḥ. It is justified through the Haima sūtra aṁśādṛtoḥ, whose relevance is preserved by permitting suffixation even in avayava-compounds. While Patañjali limits the rule’s applicability, Hemahansagaṇi and Siddhahema-vṛtti provide a broader framework rooted in the Haima tradition. The critique by Vijayalāvaṇyasūri invites a semantic precision which, while valuable, does not override the systemic need to preserve productive suffixation rules. The paribhāṣā thus stands as a justified intervention to prevent a potential lacuna in derivation.",
      "Meaning and Application": "Those suffixes like ñit-ṇit, responsible for obtaining vṛddhi substitution, are known as vṛddhimān. Operations that are applicable to denotata of ṛtu, the same operations are also applicable to words that end with the denotatum of ṛtu. Just as in varṣāsu bhavam vārṣikam, by the word varṣā, the sūtra varṣākālebhyaḥ (H. 6.3.80) yields the suffix ikaṇ, and in pūrvaḥ prathamo’vayavo varṣāṇām pūrvavarṣa, the compound is formed either as aṁśitatpuruṣa by sūtra pūrvāparādharottaramabhinnenāṁśinā (3.1.42), or as karmadhāraya compound by sūtra pūrvāparaprathamacaramajaghanyasamānamadhyamamadhyamavīram (3.1.103), and thus in pūrvavarṣāsu bhavam pūrvavārṣikam, suffix ikaṇ is added from the word ending in varṣā as per varṣākālebhyaḥ and vṛddhi substitution occurs at the first vowel by aṁśādṛtoḥ (H. 7.4.14). Similarly, just as in śiśire bhavam śaiśiram the suffix aṇ is added based on the word ṛtu by bhartusandhyāderaṇ (6.3.89), the same occurs in pūrvaśiśire bhavam pūrvaśaiśiram by the ṛtu-ending word. Here too, the suffix aṇ is sanctioned by bhartusandhyāderaṇ, and vṛddhi at the beginning of the following member occurs through aṁśādṛtoḥ (H. 7.4.14). Why vṛddhimad? Because if the suffix is not vṛddhimad (i.e. ñit-ṇit), the derivation does not hold. For example, prāvṛṣa eṇyaḥ (6.3.92) results in eṇya suffix only after prāvṛṣ, and not after words ending in it, such as pūrvaprāvṛṣ. Hence pūrvaprāvṛṣi bhavaḥ pūrvaprāvṛṣeṇyaḥ is not valid. Why must the anterior member denote an avayava (constituent)? As previously stated, pūrvā ṛtvantarairvyavahitāśca tā varṣāśca pūrvavarṣāḥ forms a karmadhāraya compound. Later, in pūrvavarṣāsu bhavam pūrvavārṣikam and pūrvaśiśire bhavam pūrvaśaiśiram, ikaṇ is added by varṣākālebhyaḥ in the sense of kāla (time), but not because of varṣa itself. Here, pūrva is not an indicator of the avayava of varṣā, so vṛddhi does not happen in the posterior part by aṁśādṛtoḥ. It occurs in the anterior part by vṛddhi svareṣvādeḥ ñiti taddhite (7.4.1)."

    "text": {
      "source": "In the Haima system, the original position (sthānī) for hrasva and dīrgha substitutions is not always indicated explicitly. As noted by Hemahansagaṇi, this very omission (sthānīn-anupādāna) becomes the jñāpaka, the indicative sign, for the existence of this paribhāṣā. He asserts that hrasva and dīrgha are always prescribed only for svaras, even when the sthānī is unexpressed. The absence of mention is, therefore, itself informative. In contrast, pluta-vidhi, or operations prescribing the pluta vowel, does provide the sthānī explicitly, as in the sūtra sammatyasūyākopakutsaneṣvādyāmantryamādau svareṣvantyaśca plutaḥ H 7/4/89, where the svara is overtly stated. Hence, Hemahansagaṇi explains that inclusion of pluta in this paribhāṣā is only due to its conceptual proximity to hrasva and dīrgha, not out of grammatical necessity. However, for grammarians who omit the sthānī even in pluta-related operations, this paribhāṣā serves as an indicator there as well.",
      "historicity": "This paribhāṣā appears unique to the Siddha-Haima tradition. It is absent from the Pāṇinian grammatical school in the form it appears here. Nevertheless, the intention of this paribhāṣā finds a conceptual parallel in Pāṇini’s rule acaś ca (P. 1.2.28), which indicates that vowel substitutions such as hrasva, dīrgha, and pluta are only applicable to vowels. The Mahābhāṣya commentary on this sūtra considers whether acaś ca is a śeṣa (completion) or apavāda (exception) to alo’ntyasya, ultimately leaning on the function of limiting substitutional scope to vowel-only positions. It clearly states that such operations are governed by the presence of a vowel (ac) at the substituendum. Patañjali demonstrates this through the exclusion of cases like śamādi and hanigamya, where the substitution applies only due to their vowel-final form, and not otherwise. The Mahābhāṣya also links the necessity of ac-grahaṇa to avoiding its misapplication in samudāya (clusters) and saṃyoga (conjuncts), emphasizing the vowel-centric nature of these operations. Furthermore, the Mahābhāṣya on P. 1.1.10 na’jjhalau addresses the question of whether consonants like ś can be considered similar (savarṇa) to vowels like i or ī, and effectively negates any such correspondence. Patañjali dismisses the potential of vowel-consonant savarṇya (homogeneity) by arguing that the phonetic definitions and classifications (ac, hal) are fundamentally exclusive in their application. The implication here supports Hemacandra’s need to establish a separate nyāya for his system, where savarṇya between vowel and consonant was not already prohibited. Nandighoṣavijaya, in his Hindi commentary, affirms that Bhoja also accepted this paribhāṣā as valid. However, modern surveys such as K.V. Abhyankar’s Paribhāṣāsaṃgraha do not include this rule in the Bhoja tradition’s list, suggesting either an omission or that Bhoja did not formalize it into an explicit paribhāṣā-sūtra.",
      "observation": "This paribhāṣā is best seen as a vācnikī nyāya—a grammarian’s formalization of a practice otherwise inferred from usage. Its necessity arises because, in the absence of a prohibition like na’jjhalau in the Haima system, vowel-consonant savarṇya remains unrestricted. Thus, to prevent erroneous substitution at consonantal positions, Hemacandra introduces this rule. The internal structure of the Haima grammar, with its implicit sthānī-based derivations and context-driven substitutions, necessitates such clarifying paribhāṣās. That Patanjali in the Mahābhāṣya needs to explicitly clarify these distinctions underscores the shared challenge between systems of ensuring grammatical substitutions remain correctly targeted.",
      "conclusion": "This paribhāṣā demonstrates the Siddha-Haima system’s careful articulation of substitutional domains, in which the boundaries between ac and hal are not assumed, as in the Pāṇinian system, but must be explicitly drawn. In the absence of rules like na’jjhalau, this paribhāṣā functions as a safeguard against overgeneralization. While its semantic counterpart exists in the Pāṇinian acaś ca, the necessity of its formalization in Hemacandra’s grammar reveals a different textual environment where implicit understandings of sthānī and savarṇya were not systemically protected. Hence, this paribhāṣā occupies a critical role in maintaining structural clarity in the operations of hrasva, dīrgha, and pluta substitutions within the Haima tradition.",
      "Meaning and Application": "This paribhāṣā lays down that the substitutes termed hrasva (short), dīrgha (long), and pluta (prolonged) apply only at the position of a vowel (svara) and not at that of a consonant (vyāñjana). In the absence of this rule, due to the frequent omission of the original vowel (sthānī) in aphorisms prescribing such substitutions, a possibility of erroneous application at consonantal positions arises. This paribhāṣā thus restricts such substitutional operations to vowels. Hemahansagaṇi explicates the scope of this paribhāṣā with precise examples. In the phrase saḥ śriyā – saśrikulam, by the sūtra klibe H 2/4/97, the ī-kāra of śri is replaced by i-kāra due to the rule of hrasva. However, there is a possibility, in absence of this paribhāṣā, of the lṛ-kāra being substituted at the place of a consonant like t in tat, merely on account of proximity in place of articulation. The paribhāṣā acts as a check on such overextensions. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri, in his Taraṅgā ṭīkā, clarifies that this rule is neither an exception (apavāda) to the Pāṇinian principle ṣaṣṭhyāntasya (P. 7.4.106), nor a subsidiary part (śeṣabhūta) of it. Rather, it is an independent rule, operating in its own domain, especially in the Siddha-Haima system where the role of sthānī is often implicit and left unspecified. He demonstrates that the paribhāṣā explicitly rules out the possibility of hrasva, dīrgha, or pluta occurring at consonantal positions by reinforcing the position of svara as the sole eligible recipient of these substitutions."

    "text": {
      "source": "The justification for this paribhāṣā is twofold: The exclusion of ṇi from \"ya svare pādaḥ padaṇikyaghuṭi\" (H 2.1.102) presumes that ṇi is svarādi; if this assumption were not made, there would be no need to exclude it. Thus, the nyāya provides the conceptual basis for that operation. In H 4.3.15 \"hviṇor apv iti vyau\", the replacement of final i by y (in roots like iṇ) assumes that iṇ ends in i (i-varṇānta). Without this paribhāṣā, such a substitution would not occur since iṇ would not satisfy the terminal condition. Nandighoṣavijaya in his Hindi commentary echoes this and adds that the nyāya serves to make such substitutions possible when the usual syntactic requirements (multiple letters or words) are not met. He also observes the practical motivation of the paribhāṣā: “...taṇyantareṇa yatnaṇ na sidhyanti ityekasminn ādyantavad vacanam.”",
      "historicity": "This paribhāṣā is already formulated in the Aṣṭādhyāyī and hence was not separately listed in dedicated paribhāṣā works in the Pāṇinian tradition. However, in non-Pāṇinian schools like Cāndra and Kātantra, it receives independent treatment. Durgasiṃha’s Paribhāṣāvṛtti cites jñāpakas such as \"gamhanajanakhanaghasām upadhāyāḥ\" (3.6.43) and \"iṇaś ca\" (3.4.59). Thus, its acceptance transcends schools, although its formal appearance varies.",
      "observation": "This paribhāṣā removes structural limitations in grammar by recognizing a conceptual symmetry in units that are structurally singular. Nandighoṣavijaya critiques the universal applicability of this paribhāṣā to both letters and words, arguing that Hemacandra provides examples for letters but not explicitly for words. This critique is supported by Nāgeśa in his discussion on vyapadeśivadekasmin, where he dismisses Kaiyaṭṭa's broader interpretation. Patañjali, however, supports this logic through everyday analogies. He compares grama as a multi-entity word (village, hall, area, or people), but notes how even a single-hall village may still be designated as grama (ekashāla grāmaḥ). By this logic, singular items take on plural conceptual forms. Similarly, he shows how terms like pada, ṛk, sūktam can apply to single units (ekapada, ekṛca, ekasūktam). These support the paribhāṣā by loka-siddhi.",
      "conclusion": "The paribhāṣā “ādyantavadekasmin” is an essential conceptual tool in the Hemacandra system that enables syntactic flexibility where structural conditions are not fully met. By assuming positional properties in single units, it facilitates operations which are otherwise inaccessible. It is historically attested in multiple traditions, albeit with different treatments. While its universality (word vs. letter) is debated among commentators like Kaiyaṭṭa, Nāgeśa, and Nandighoṣavijaya, its practical role is indisputable and finds justification in both textual evidence (jñāpaka) and loka-vyavahāra, as affirmed by Patañjali.",
      "Meaning and Application": "The paribhāṣā \"ādyantavadekasmin\" establishes that in instances where only a single sound or word exists, that unit is treated both as the initial (ādi) and as the final (anta). This treatment enables grammatical operations that are otherwise restricted to either the beginning or end of a term to be validly applied even when such positional plurality is absent. The purpose is to extend the applicability of positional operations to such singular units, making this paribhāṣā an instance of aprāpta-prāpaṇa-arthatva. The text Nyāyasaṃgraha states: “Yatraika eva varṇo nāma vā’sti, kāryaṇ tu tadādikasya tadantasya voktaṇ; tatra tadevaikamāditvenāntatvena ca prakalpya tatkāryaṇ kāryam… aprāpta-prāpaṇārtho’yaṃ nyāyaḥ.” This underscores that where grammatical operations rely on adjacency or boundary positioning, the singular unit is assumed to possess both features. For instance, in roots like īhāṇcakre, the dhātu is treated as starting with a guru vowel due to this nyāya, hence permitting suffixation by ām via sūtra H 3.4.48 (\"gurunāmyāderanṛcchūrṇoḥ\"). Similarly, in īṇc gatau, the same logic applies. In both cases, although the ādi or anta element is not followed or preceded by anything else, it can still perform its grammatical function due to the assumption of duality. In the nominal domain, the “Indre” sūtra (H 1.2.30) and its interpretation via the paribhāṣā “saptamyā ādiḥ” (H 7.4.114) allows substitution based on the presence of “indra” as the beginning of the following word. This substitution would not be possible if “indra” stood alone unless we assume it to be both ādi and anta, thus triggering the operation. This is also affirmed in the Mahābhāṣya (on Aṣṭādhyāyī 1.4.1) where Patañjali explains that this paribhāṣā is necessary only in the absence of another element that would otherwise serve as the beginning or end. He reinforces the applicability of ādi and anta status to singular elements through several analogies drawn from loka-vyavahāra such as ekapada, ekṛca, and ekasūktam."

      "source": "The form kriyāḥ in the sūtra parivyavāt kriyaḥ (H 3.3.27) itself acts as the jñāpaka for this paribhāṣā. Hemahāṃsagaṇi and Nāgeśa both cite this derivation as grammatically untenable without assuming prakṛtivad-anukaraṇam. Nāgeśa writes: “Kṣiyaḥ itīyaṅ-nirdeśo’syā jñāpakaḥ.” This indicates that iyaṅ ādeśa can apply even in the absence of dhātutva, but only when the form imitates a root. Patañjali, in his commentary on kṣiyo dīrghāt (P. 8.2.46), defends the form kṣiyaḥ with the remark: “Naiṣa dhātuḥ — dhātor eṣo’nukaraṇam. Yady anukaraṇam, iyaṅ-ādeśo na prāpnoti. Prakṛtivad-anukaraṇaṃ bhavatīty iyaṅ-ādeśo bhaviṣyati.” He clearly states that iy ādeśa is justified only by invoking this principle. Additionally, the non-eternal nature (anityatva) of this nyāya is indicated by the use of tadaḥ instead of tasmāt in the sūtra tadaḥ seḥ svare pādārthāḥ (H 9.3.45), as both Hemahāṃsagaṇi and Nāgeśa observe. If this paribhāṣā were nitya, the word tasmāt would have been required to indicate rule-justified extension.",
      "historicity": "The prakṛtivad-anukaraṇam principle is first explicitly formulated in the Mahābhāṣya on kṣiyo dīrghāt (P. 8.2.46). Patañjali introduces it to explain why iy ādeśa can occur for kṣi, even though kṣi lacks dhātutva. His wording— “prakṛtivad-anukaraṇaṃ bhavati” —suggests an analogical mechanism whereby a non-root is treated like a root for specific grammatical purposes. Later grammarians retained this principle while refining its scope. Nāgeśa incorporates it in Paribhāṣenduśekhara, grounding it in concrete examples and emphasizing its conditional application. Śeṣādri, in Paribhāṣābhāskara, critiques its overextension and treats it as context-sensitive. Nandighoṣavijaya, writing within the Jain tradition, adds a metalinguistic layer by distinguishing śabdānukaraṇa (imitation of the word) and śabdārthānukaraṇa (imitation of the word-meaning), and ties its validity to the grammatical intention (vivakṣā). He also notes the probable loss of portions of Hemahāṃsagaṇi’s original vṛtti, suggesting that the term śabdārthānukaraṇam was part of the original but later omitted in copies.",
      "observation": "A comparative view of the sources reveals consensus on the function of this paribhāṣā but divergence in its scope and theoretical grounding: Hemahāṃsagaṇi presents a clear and measured application. He allows iy ādeśa via prakṛtivadbhāva, but disallows tyādi suffixes, confirming that full dhātutva is not established.Patañjali, while accepting the form kṣiyaḥ as valid, cautions that treating anukaraṇa as prakṛti should not override natural derivation (svādhyutpatti). He presents this paribhāṣā as an ātideśa, not as a universally valid principle.Nāgeśa upholds the paribhāṣā but explicitly labels it anityā, since it depends on derived prātipadikatva for vibhakti assignment.Nandighoṣavijaya refines the interpretation further, linking the operation to the presence or absence of bheda-vivakṣā or abheda-vivakṣā. He distinguishes cases where only the śabda is imitated from those where both śabda and artha are present, thereby determining whether the grammatical operation (prakṛtivadbhāva) applies. Thus, while all commentators accept the derivational necessity of this principle, none treat it as a blanket license for treating anukaraṇa as prakṛti in all cases. Instead, they emphasize its contextual justification, operational limits, and dependence on intention or form-based mimicry.",
      "conclusion": "The paribhāṣā prakṛtivad-anukaraṇam affirms that imitation may warrant root-like grammatical treatment, but only under defined constraints. Its operation is legitimized by forms like kriyāḥ and kṣiyaḥ, but always within the framework of ātideśa—not as a rule of default identity. The convergence of Patañjali, Hemahāṃsagaṇi, Nāgeśa, and Nandighoṣavijaya reveals its functional role as a necessary exception, not a universal norm. Its theoretical grounding in jñāpaka, prātipadikatva, vivakṣā, and anityatva makes it a nuanced yet indispensable instrument in Sanskrit grammatical reasoning.",
      "Meaning and Application": "The term prakṛti refers to the entity being imitated, such as a dhātu or other grammatical primitive. The form that imitates this prakṛti—the anukaraṇa—is treated analogously to the original, and undergoes the same grammatical operations. For example, in the sūtra parivyavāt kriyaḥ (H 3.3.27), the form kriyāḥ is derived from kṛī, which is not a formal dhātu. Yet, due to prakṛtivadbhāva—the principle that imitation functions like the original—the iy ādeśa prescribed in saṃyogāt (H 2.1.52) is applied to kṛī, just as it would be to a genuine root. Hemahāṃsagaṇi clarifies this with the statement: “Dhātv-anukaraṇasya kṛī ityasya dhātuvadbhāvād dhātukāryaṃ ‘saṃyogāt’ itīyādeśaḥ siddhaḥ.” However, this imitation is not total: tyādi suffixes (reserved for actual dhātus) are excluded due to the absence of full dhātutva, while syādi suffixes are permitted. This distinction underlines that prakṛtivadbhāva allows selective grammatical treatment, not a blanket identity."

      "source": "The jñāpaka for this paribhāṣā in Hemacandra’s system is the sūtra: vātātīsārapiśācātkaścāntaḥ (H 7/2/61)Here, the form atisārakī is derived despite lacking the long ī seen in atīsāra, indicating that the partially modified form atisāra is treated as equivalent to atīsāra for the purpose of derivation. This implies ekadeśavikṛtam ananyavat. A second jñāpaka comes from: jarāyā jarasvā (H 2/1/3)Despite shortening of the ā in jarā due to klībe (H 2/4/97), jaras is still substituted, which can only be justified if the modified atijara is treated as non-distinct. A further indication of the paribhāṣā’s anityatva is seen in: saṅkhyārhadivāvibhāniśāprabhābhāścitrakarnādyantānantakārabāhvarurdhanurnāndīlipilivibalibhaktikṣetrajanghākṣapākṣaṇadārajanidoṣādinadivasāṭṭaḥ (H 5/1/102)Both lipi and livi are explicitly listed; if this paribhāṣā were nitya, one would suffice. Additional support is found in comparative literature: Mahābhāṣya on P. 4.1.83 prāgdīvyato’ṇ: The paribhāṣā is invoked by Patañjali to justify derivations despite lack of direct textual support, indicating its practical necessity in grammatical explanation. Paribhāṣenduśekhara of Nāgeśa: Nāgeśa affirms this principle, emphasizing the semantic continuity preserved through partial modification. These supplementary references affirm the relevance and antiquity of the principle, but the primary authority remains the internal grammatical logic of Hemacandra’s system.",
      "historicity": "Though Hemacandra institutionalizes this paribhāṣā in his grammar, its conceptual origin predates him. A similar notion is indirectly acknowledged in the Mahābhāṣya (P. 4.1.83), where the use of dīvyati in the derivation of dīvyat is justified despite phonological transformation. Nāgeśa elaborates on this in Paribhāṣenduśekhara, reinforcing the idea that grammar must accommodate partial modifications when the identity of the base word is not lost. Nandighoṣavijaya’s commentary offers both agreement and qualification. He notes that the term vikṛta in the paribhāṣā can be interpreted either as \"visadṛśa\" (visibly different) or \"vikāra-panna\" (actually modified). He accepts the latter, arguing that superficial resemblance is insufficient and that genuine morphophonemic change is the intended target of this rule. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri strongly endorses the second interpretation and rejects the idea that the rule applies to mere accidental resemblance. He supports Hemacandra’s contextual deployment of the paribhāṣā but warns against extending it to forms where morphological motivation is no longer transparent.",
      "observation": "This paribhāṣā reveals the tension between form and function in Sanskrit derivation. It grants flexibility to the derivational machinery by allowing certain deviations from the base form, as long as the core identity remains intact. However, the application of the rule is bounded—once modification crosses a threshold (i.e., when more than half the word is altered), ananyavat ceases to apply. In such cases, one must invoke sthānivatbhāva or even rely on semantic reinterpretation through upacāra (as in bhūtapūrvakatadvadupacāraḥ). Nandighoṣavijaya and Hemahāṃsagaṇi both warn against overextending this principle, especially when the semantic content of the original prakṛti becomes obscured. Similarly, śūra ≠ sūra is used to argue against overapplication of the rule when the modified form is no longer part of the relevant gaṇa. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri further elaborates on this point by referencing the sūtra vivadha-vīvadhādvā (H 6/4/25), suggesting that when variant forms arise through vowel lengthening or other phonological changes, they should be treated as distinct if both are explicitly mentioned. This supports the anityatva of the rule.",
      "conclusion": "Ekadeśavikṛtam ananyavat serves a crucial function in Hemacandra’s grammatical framework. It supports derivational economy by treating modified forms as grammatically equivalent to their bases. However, its application is neither universal nor obligatory. The rule’s scope must be carefully bounded by observable identity and supported by jñāpaka sūtras, as in vātātīsārapiśācāt and jarāyā jarasvā. Comparisons with the Pāṇinian system (e.g., Mahābhāṣya and Nāgeśa) reveal conceptual parallels, but the normative grammar for this thesis remains Hemacandra's Śabdānuśāsana, and the Nyāyasaṃgraha stands as the authoritative paribhāṣā text.",
      "Meaning and Application": "The paribhāṣā ekadeśavikṛtam ananyavat establishes that a word which has undergone a partial modification (vikṛti) does not lose its original grammatical identity or functions. The phrase literally means \"a partially modified entity is treated as if it were unmodified.\" That is, even though a segment of a word has changed, the resultant form is not regarded as grammatically distinct (anya), and the linguistic operations applicable to the unmodified word remain equally valid for the modified one. This rule allows grammatical processes—like affixation, substitution, or transformation—to apply to partially altered forms of a base word (prakṛti), treating them as essentially the same. It avoids unnecessary multiplication of grammatical rules for trivially varied surface forms and ensures consistency across derivations. For example: In the case of atīsāro’syāstītyatīsārakī, the derivation uses the form atisāra with short i. However, the rule vātātīsārapiśācātkaścāntaḥ (H 7/2/61) allows the affixation of the in suffix and insertion of the augment ka, treating both atīsāra and atisāra as functionally equivalent. Similarly, when the word jarā is declined using the suffix ṭā, it undergoes a substitution (jaras), and in forms like atijarasā kulena, despite the internal phonological alteration (shortening of ā by H 2/4/97 klībe), the substitution jaras is still valid by H 2/1/3 jarāyā jarasvā. Moreover, the scope of this paribhāṣā extends by implication to anekadeśavikṛta cases as well. For instance, in praṇihata, the deletion of n by yamiraminamigamihanmanivanatitanāderdhuti kṅiti (H 4/2/55) qualifies as a partial modification. Even in more complex forms like praṇighnanti, where multiple segments are altered (e.g., deletion of a by gamahanajanakhanaghasaḥ svare’nangi kṅiti luk H 4/2/44, and substitution hna → ghna by H 2/1/112 hano hno ghnah), the word is still treated as ananyavat for further operations, as evidenced in H 2/3/79 nermādāpatapadanadagadavapīvahīśamūcigyātivātidrātipsātisyātihantidegdhau, where ṇatva applies. Nāgeśa also explicitly cites this paribhāṣā in Paribhāṣenduśekhara, affirming that partial modification does not hinder grammatical operations when the semantic or morphological identity remains intact. For instance, in the case rāmau (dual form), despite the vowel substitution (ai → au), the suffix suP applies because rāma is still semantically and grammatically identifiable. The Hindi commentary by Nandighoṣavijaya offers further clarification. He emphasizes that if even a portion of the prakṛti undergoes a change (vaipadika-vaisadṛśya), it is not sufficient to render it a distinct grammatical entity. The underlying identity remains preserved unless the extent of modification obscures the original form entirely. He also discusses the limits of the rule, for instance where too much of the word is modified, in which case sthānivat or bhūtapūrvakatadvadupacāraḥ would become relevant. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri, in his Sanskrit commentary Taraṅgā on Nyāyasamuccaya, raises a counterpoint against interpreting the term vikṛta merely in the sense of vaisadṛśya (superficial dissimilarity). He insists that vikāra-panna vaisadṛśya—genuine phonological or morphological alteration—is essential for the rule’s application. He further disputes the appropriateness of the example atīsārakī, arguing that if both atīsāra and atisāra are equally valid, the derivation should be governed by the paribhāṣā bhūtapūrvakastadvadupacāraḥ. However, acknowledging Hemacandra’s own usage of ekadeśavikṛtam ananyavat in the derivation, Vijayalāvaṇyasūri concedes its contextual applicability while reaffirming the necessity of interpretive caution."

      "source": "The primary jñāpaka cited by Hemahāṃsagaṇi is the very absence of vadha in the sūtra neṅrmādāpatapad... H 2/3/79, despite its functional relevance. He interprets this omission as indicative of an upacāra of han in vadha. By not listing vadha, the sūtra implicitly validates the paribhāṣā: had vadha been considered a distinct root, it would have required explicit mention. This aligns with the example of praṇyavadhīt, where ṇatva arises due to the assumed presence of han through vadha. Additionally, the impermanence (anityatā) of this paribhāṣā is inferred from saṅkhyānāṃ ṣṇām... H 1/4/33, wherein the plural form ṣṇām is interpreted to necessitate explicit mention due to the inapplicability of the nyāya in all contexts. The example of aṣṭānām—involving earlier aṣṭan—suggests that the rule’s application depends on recognizing the nakārānta character of the prior form, which is not always inferable unless explicitly invoked, hence requiring pluralization.",
      "historicity": "In the Pāṇinian tradition, this nyāya finds expression in Vyādi’s Paribhāṣāsūcana as: bhūtapūrvagati-riha śāstre sambhavati (sūtra 14) Vyādi clarifies that operations in grammar often depend on the earlier state of a form, not just its current structure. The interpretation is supported by his example from oka ucaḥ ke... P 7.3.64, where the substitution is valid only when the earlier phonological condition is restored figuratively. This anticipates the paribhāṣā as an inferential tool (anumāna) for rule eligibility in modified contexts.",
      "observation": "In Nandighoṣavijaya’s Hindi commentary, the author elaborates on the validity of the example praṇyavadhīt. He concurs with Hemahāṃsagaṇi's stance that vadha must be regarded as han to justify the ṇatva, since under the varṇavidhi model of sthānīvāvarṇavidhau (H 7/4/109), vadha cannot function as a sthānī. Thus, only the application of this paribhāṣā can sustain the rule. However, Nandighoṣavijaya is critical of Hemahāṃsagaṇi’s identification of the jñāpaka. He argues that the non-mention of a substitute in the sūtra does not by itself constitute proof of a paribhāṣā. For a valid jñāpaka, either the behavior of forms in actual derivation or the authoritative inclusion of examples in vṛtti texts should substantiate the inference. He also notes that Hemahāṃsagaṇi himself has not shown this nyāya's application explicitly in the vṛtti of neṅrmādāpatapad, weakening the legitimacy of the claimed jñāpaka. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri, in his Nyāyasamuccaya, outright rejects Hemahāṃsagaṇi’s reliance on this example. He contends that ṇatva in praṇyavadhīt can be derived using sthānīvāvarṇavidhau, and no special paribhāṣā is needed. He further objects to considering this nyāya a basis for rules which are already governed by direct paribhāṣā-sūtras like H 7/4/109 and H 7/4/110. The tension between these views illustrates two divergent approaches: Hemahāṃsagaṇi’s attempt to trace deeper structural logic via upacāra, and Vijayalāvaṇyasūri’s insistence on keeping paribhāṣās distinct from sūtras established by direct assertion (pratyakṣa-siddha). Nandighoṣavijaya mediates between the two, affirming the example but demanding better jñāpaka inference.",
      "conclusion": "This paribhāṣā exemplifies the critical tension in grammatical methodology between structural substitution and morphological continuity. It affirms the legitimacy of applying rules not merely to the surface forms but to entities bearing structural identity with their antecedents. While its jñāpaka remains contested, its functional necessity is evident in examples like praṇyavadhīt, where standard paribhāṣās fail to justify the derivation. Hemahāṃsagaṇi’s formulation thus contributes a valuable heuristic tool in the Haimavyākaraṇa tradition, even as its status remains anitya and context-dependent.",
      "Meaning and Application": "The paribhāṣā bhūtapūrvakastadvadupacāraḥ posits that an entity which earlier existed in a particular form, though presently altered, is to be treated by upacāra (figurative extension) as if it retains its former state for the purpose of grammatical operations. This principle permits the application of rules to a derivative or substituted form based on its historical or morphological antecedent. Hemahāṃsagaṇi illustrates this principle through the derivation of praṇyavadhīt. Though the root vadha appears here, it is treated as if it were han, because vadha is the substitute (ādeśa) of han. Consequently, the rule neṅrmādāpatapad... H 2/3/79 applies, allowing for ṇatva (substitution of ṇ for n), which ordinarily would apply only if han were directly present. This upacāra enables vadha, the substituted root, to be processed under rules applicable to han, by virtue of its bhūtapūrvatva. Such figurative continuity ensures that grammatical operations are not constrained by surface-level substitutions, but rather account for morphological ancestry. Hemahāṃsagaṇi's formulation thus anticipates the need to bridge substituted and substituting forms through historical continuity, a device vital for uniform rule-application across derivative forms."

      "source": "Hemahansagaṇi locates the jñāpaka in the use of the word pade in the above sūtra. Since pade presupposes already-formed padas, the fact that ṇatva applies even in pre-pada forms like ravaṇam indicates that the sūtra accommodates a not-yet-existent state as if it were present. However, this interpretation is challenged. Nandighoṣavijaya critiques this identification of pade as the jñāpaka. He points out that in the extended vṛtti on the sūtra, Hemahansagaṇi himself earlier identifies the entire compound ekapade as the jñāpaka—not merely pade. He also stresses that the padatva that is “anticipated” must be distinguished from real-time padatva, and ṇatva must not be misapplied without epistemological caution. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri goes further, arguing that the term pade functions to limit the domain of application to contexts where both nimitta and nimittin occur in the same pada. It is not meant to trigger a presumption of future padatva. Thus, according to him, this is not a valid jñāpaka for the nyāya. That this paribhāṣā is not universally applicable is demonstrated through the example apāṭhīt. In such forms, aṭ-āgama is added after the completion of all root-related operations. If this nyāya were nitya, then aṭ would be assumed to exist beforehand, and vṛddhi would follow via svarādestāsu (H 4/4/31). But that is not observed. Instead, vṛddhi is implemented via vyañjanādau upāntyasyātaḥ (H 4/3/47), which does not rely on bhūtavad assumptions. This proves the anityatva of the nyāya. Nandighoṣavijaya invokes the sentence odanaṃ pacati (he cooks rice). In actual usage, what is cooked is raw rice, but odana refers to cooked rice. So the expression presupposes a future state (bhāt) as already real—mirroring the logic of this nyāya. Thus, even though the example comes from common language, it reinforces the acceptability of such a presumption in grammatical theory.The Pāṇinian system does not formally adopt this as a paribhāṣā. However, Vyādi in Paribhāṣāsūcana (sūtra 14) presents the equivalent: bhūtapūrvagatir iha śāstre sambhavati, explicitly acknowledging the role of anticipatory states in grammatical reasoning. More explicitly, the Jainendra and Bhoja grammatical traditions accept this as a formal paribhāṣā. In Jainendra’s framework, the transformation of tad or tyad into feminine forms like sā before the addition of syādi affixes uses this logic. The anticipated presence of the affix justifies an earlier phonetic change (replacement of d by a), even before it is structurally present.",

While the nyāya is not fully admitted in the core Pāṇinian system, its conceptual utility is affirmed in Jainendra and Bhoja traditions.",
      "Meaning and Application": "This paribhāṣā encapsulates a crucial interpretive device in Sanskrit grammar: treating a grammatical condition that will definitively arise in the future as though it already exists in the present. This “as-if-accomplished” assumption allows certain rules to apply even before their formal triggers (nimitta) are fully realized. The primary example is the application of ṇatva via the sūtra raṣṛvarṇānno ṇa ekapade’nantyasyālacaṭatavargaśasāntare (H 2/3/63). In the case of nṛṇām, padatva is already available, so the application is uncontroversial. However, in forms like ravaṇam, takṣaṇam, the suffixes (syādi-pratyayas) which bestow padatva have not yet appeared at the point of ṇatva-application. Yet, ṇatva is observed, implying that the future padatva is being treated as if already present. This is the essence of bhūtavadupacāra in a bhāvini state."

Nandighoṣavijaya remarks that a more concise formulation like \"cachaṭaṭhataṭha\" could have served the mechanical function of the rule. However, the deliberate use of a longer and heavier form (guru-sūtra) enables the application of yathāsaṅkhyam, particularly when matching śaṣa and śaṣam across two paired groups. Without this intentional structuring, the sequence would not be recoverable from the sūtra structure alone. The jñāpaka thus reinforces that the sequential pairing is not incidental but structurally encoded in the sūtra’s grammatical design.",
      "historicity": "This paribhāṣā is attested in the Kātantra, Kālāpa, and Bhoja grammatical systems, where it enjoys recognition as a formal principle. However, it remains absent from the Śākāṭāyana, Cāndra, and Jainendra traditions, suggesting that the enforcement of sequential matching was not universally standardized across all grammatical schools. In the Jain tradition, especially within the Siddhahemavyākaraṇa, the paribhāṣā receives a formal status, but only when both saṅkhyā and vacana symmetry are satisfied.",
      "observation": "This nyāya is not universally applicable. As the Nyāyasaṅgraha itself notes, the clause \"samānām\" in the paribhāṣā is critical, since yathāsaṅkhyam fails to apply when the elements are unequal either in grammatical number (vacana) or in total count (saṅkhyā). For example: In namaspuraso gateḥ kakhapaphiraḥsaḥ (H.2.3.1), even though namas and puras are grouped with kakhapapha, yathāsaṅkhyam fails because the nimitta and nimittis are unequal in number. Similarly, in tau mumo vyañjane svau (H.1.3.14), the mu-forms and their nasal replacements differ in vacana, thereby disqualifying them from yathāsaṅkhyam matching, even if their semantic or positional roles suggest otherwise. Patañjali discusses this principle explicitly in his Mahābhāṣya on P.1.3.10. He presents three case categories where yathāsaṅkhyam becomes necessary: Where multiple saṅjñās and samāsas are used together and could otherwise lead to sarva-prasaṅga (universal application). When the enumerated lists (such as suffixes or replacement items) are equal in number but differ semantically, and matching based on order avoids over-extension. In cases of possible śabdataḥ or arthataḥ mapping ambiguities—i.e., when it is not clear whether pairing should be based on wording or meaning—yathāsaṅkhyam ensures structural discipline. However, Patañjali also enumerates several contexts where even sama-saṅkhyā and sama-vacana fail to trigger yathāsaṅkhyam. These include derivations involving: nandigrahipacādibhyaḥ lyuṇinyacaḥ (P.3.1.134), sindhutakṣaśilādibhyo’ṇaññau (P.4.3.93), kartṛkarmanoh bhūkṛññoḥ (P.3.1.66), and ṛtuyajñebhyaśca (P.4.3.87), where either the count or the morphosyntactic environments prevent the straightforward application of this paribhāṣā. Even when svarita is used as a marker of emphasis, it does not suffice to enforce the principle universally.",

It derives its authority from explicit structural encoding in sūtras such as caṭate sadvitīye and is supported by both internal consistency and commentator rationale. However, both the Nyāyasaṅgraha and the Mahābhāṣya confirm that its application is context-dependent, contingent upon equal grammatical number and syntactic symmetry. Its anityatā lies primarily in the vacana dimension, and it remains an essential but selective tool within both Haima and Pāṇinian traditions. Its absence from certain grammatical schools further underscores its status as a context-sensitive.",
      "Meaning and Application": "This paribhāṣā governs the relationship between two or more grammatically paired sets where members of each set are matched in a one-to-one correspondence according to their order of occurrence. Specifically, when a grammatical rule refers to multiple elements (nimittas) and their corresponding outcomes (nimittis), and both groups are equal in number (sama-saṅkhyā) and identical in grammatical number (sama-vacana), then the pairing must follow the same sequence (yathāsaṅkhya)—the first with the first, the second with the second, and so on. Any arbitrary or crosswise pairing is prohibited. The Nyāyasaṅgraha explains this principle through the sūtra ḍeṅsyoryātau (H.1.4.6), where both sthānī (ḍe, ṅsi) and ādeśa (y, āt) occur in the dual. In this setting, yathāsaṅkhyam pairing is necessary; otherwise, it could lead to confusion—e.g., pairing ḍe with āt or ṅsi with y —since the sūtra itself offers no internal prohibition to such criss-cross matching. Therefore, this nyāya functions as a niyama to prevent such ambiguity. The requirement of equal grammatical number ensures a rigid, predictable mapping of items across the two sets."

      "source": "The source of this nyāya is the sūtra smṛtyarthadayeśaḥ (H 2.2.11). Through this sūtra, even the term karma is considered as an alternative expression for karma, and thus, within karma also, the possibility of akarmatva (non-karma) is indicated. In the case of each root verb, when the intention is to denote kārakas like kartā (agent), karma (object), etc., in the forms kartā, karma, etc., they are considered as such. This type of arrangement is established by this nyāya. Therefore, according to this nyāya, just as it occurs with each verbal root, similarly, the karma of the verbal roots indicated by the sūtra smṛtyarthadayeśaḥ can also be understood as both karma and akarma in accordance with the intention of karmatva. Thus, there is no need to alternately term the karma of these verbal roots as akarma using the sūtra smṛtyarthadayeśaḥ (H 2.2.11), but the composition of this sūtra implies that this restrictive sūtra has been derived based on the nyāya siddhe satyārambho niyamārthaḥ (N 1.25). In other words, the sūtra H 2.2.11 indicates that elsewhere, the term karma is not designated as akarma. If this nyāya did not exist, then the sūtra H 2.2.11 which holds the status of a restrictive rule (niyama sūtra) would have remained only a prescriptive rule (vidhi-sūtra). This nyāya is impermanent, and hence there will be no kāraka in the case of sambandha. Therefore, in the sentence bahūnām idaṃ vastram, the suffix pśas by the word bahu cannot be added, as specified by the rule bahvalpārthāt kārakādiṣṭāniṣṭe pśas (H 7.2.150).",
      "historicity": "This rule (paribhāṣā) is not directly found as a nyāya in the Pāṇinian system. However, it is implicitly accepted through the consistent use seen in the Mahābhāṣya, especially under the sūtra kārake (P 1.4.23), where it is stated that kārakas are dependent on vivakṣā (the speaker's intention). This view is echoed in the Nyāyasamuccaya, which affirms that while this is not a Pāṇinian nyāya, it is accepted in practice by the Bhāṣyakāra, and therefore functions as an established grammatical principle. Moreover, the sūtra kārake, though in the saptamī case, operates under the saṃjñā-adhikāra to indicate a technical designation rather than a case marker, reinforcing the idea that kāraka status is vivakṣā-based.",
      "observation": "This nyāya demonstrates that kārakas are designated not merely by formal morphological case endings or Pāṇinian saṃjñās, but by the intended syntactic-semantic relationship between the word and the action (kriyā). This is governed by vivakṣā—the speaker’s intention—and supported by both Bhāṣya examples and logical necessity (anyathānupapatti). Even without a formal saṃjñā, if a word functions as the instrument, object, or agent of the verb, it behaves as a kāraka. This supports the fundamental grammatical flexibility needed to accommodate semantic reality in usage.",
      "conclusion": "The principle of vivakṣātaḥ kārakāṇi highlights the speaker’s intentionality as the decisive factor in assigning kāraka-roles. This goes beyond rigid technical definitions and allows for interpretive elasticity in the grammatical structure. While not a formally codified Pāṇinian paribhāṣā, its repeated validation in the Mahābhāṣya, its acceptance in Nyāyasamuccaya, and its presence in non-Pāṇinian traditions such as Bhoja and Cāndra make it a practically authoritative grammatical rule. Its impermanence (anityatā) applies only in the sense that no new kāraka can be artificially created, but where functional participation in an action is visible and intended, kārakatva can be attributed accordingly.",
      "Meaning and Application": "The kārakas either exist according to the intention (vivakṣā) of the speaker, or do not exist, or they interchange—meaning one takes the place of another. The purpose of this nyāya is to refute the assertion that kārakas are fixed due to their unique characteristics. In this context, even in the absence of the kārakas, there is still a presence of kārakas in a certain sense. For example, in the usage bhikṣā vāsayati, there is no actual functional role (vyāpāratva) in the terms bhikṣā (alms) and others, and they are merely used as causative agents (hetutva). Consequently, they are not kārakas in a substantive sense. However, due to the desire for a specific form of expression, the word vāsana implies the doer (kartā), thus making it a kāraka. Nevertheless, in the true sense, bhikṣā and similar terms are not kārakas. If bhikṣā and similar terms had kārakatva (the nature of being a kāraka), then in the compound form like bhikṣayoṣita, samāsa would have been formed following the sūtra kārakaṃ kṛtā (H 3.1.68), but that is not the case. This shows that bhikṣā and similar terms have akārakatva (non-kāraka nature), and the use of the kartā-kāraka (agent case) in the form bhikṣā vāsayati is subordinated to the desire for a specific expression. In this context, even when being a kāraka, there is still a condition of being non-kāraka. For instance, in usages like māṣāṇām aśnīyāt, even if there is karmatva (function as an object) in māṣa and the others, due to not being the intention of the speaker, it is treated as the sambandha in the sixth case (ṣaṣṭhī vibhakti) as specified by the sūtra śeṣe (H 2.2.81). The context of replacing one kāraka with another is illustrated as follows: In usages like odanaḥ svayaṃ pacyate and asi chinnatti, the kartṛ kāraka replaces the karma and karaṇa considering the speaker’s intention to treat them as independent sources of action (svatantra)."

      "source": "The sūtra samānānāṃ tena dīrghaḥ (H 1/2/1) is cited as the source for this paribhāṣā. Here, the substitution of nām for ām in the word samānānām is governed by hrasvāpaśca (1/4/32), but this substitution depends on the implied continuity (anuvṛtti) of the words ām and nām from the preceding sūtra āmo nāmvā (1/4/31). This anuvṛtti is not marked by any explicit jñāpaka but is inferred via contextual necessity, thus illustrating the working of this paribhāṣā. Similarly, in aidautsandhyakṣareḥ (1/2/12), the cessation of the influence of upasarga (from 1/2/9) occurs implicitly when the scope becomes irrelevant, again demonstrating nivṛtti through apekṣā. The paribhāṣā is explicitly stated to be anaitya (non-eternal) in the Nyāyasaṅgraha. Hemahansagaṇi explains that if the initiation and cessation of adhikāra were always determined by apekṣā, then there would be no need for indicators like ca in pratyaye ca (1/3/2) or vā in śaṣase śaṣaṃ vā (1/3/6). Their usage implies that an adhikāra may sometimes require explicit markers for its continuation or termination, showing that the rule is not universally applicable.",
      "historicity": "The Mahābhāṣya on svaritena'dhikāraḥ (P. 1.3.11) offers relevant theoretical grounding. It defines adhikāra as that which governs a range of sūtras until an explicit indicator (jñāpaka) interrupts. It also states: \"anayanirdeśaḥ tu nivartakaḥ, tasmāt paribhāṣā\"—indicating that another directive (anya-nirdeśa) can terminate the current adhikāra, hence necessitating the paribhāṣā. The need for such a rule arises from the uncertainty regarding the scope of adhikāra. The Mahābhāṣya also confirms that in absence of explicit boundaries, adhikāra may be inferred from accent (svarita) or contextual understanding. However, Hemahansagaṇi’s approach in Nyāyasaṅgraha does not rely on svarita but on apekṣā (necessity). Nandighoṣavijaya, in his Hindi commentary, stresses that in contexts where no jñāpaka exists, adhikāra must be presumed to operate as needed. He states: “ अन्यथा उसकी जहाँ जरूरत हो वहाँ कोई भी ज्ञापक होना चाहिए … यह अर्थ उसके जापक बिना ही सिद्ध होता है। ” This notion is also echoed in the Mandūkapluti-nyāya, a variation of this paribhāṣā, where an adhikāra can leap over some sūtras and resume ahead, like a frog skipping patches of land. For instance, asat in aṇuvargāt svare vo'san (1/2/40) skips aiuvarṇasyānte'nunāsiko'nīnādaḥ (1/2/41) and resumes in tṛtīyasya pañcame (1/3/1) and pratyaye ca (1/3/2). The conclusion of adhikāra is again driven by necessity, not an overt marker.",
      "observation": "Hemahansagaṇi's Haima tradition employs the term adhikāra to include both sūtra-level scope and śabdānuvṛtti. This contrasts with the Pāṇinian convention, where adhikāra typically refers to sūtrādhikāra and anuvṛtti handles verbal repetition. Nandighoṣavijaya affirms that both verbal and structural domains can fall under the purview of adhikāra in Haima and allied traditions (Cāndra, Kātantra, etc.). Further, he argues that this principle is lokasiddha (established in common speech), citing examples like “atra vidyālayae devendraḥ paṭhati, mahendraḥ adhyāpayati” where atra and vidyālayae are understood in later clauses without repetition, validating the paribhāṣā. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri offers another interpretation: the paribhāṣā becomes operative only when an otherwise continuing adhikāra must be extended to a new domain because of shifted focus or new instruction. The rule therefore governs both expected continuation and strategic re-application of adhikāra based on contextual demands.",
      "conclusion": "The paribhāṣā apekṣāto’dhikāraḥ is foundational in the Haima system for handling the scope of adhikāra where explicit jñāpakas are absent. While similar notions exist in the Pāṇinian tradition (e.g., svaritena’dhikāraḥ), the reliance on apekṣā makes the Haima rule more practical in modern contexts where accent-based interpretation is obsolete. This paribhāṣā explains both initiation and cessation of adhikāra based on relevance and is especially significant in cases involving compound scope, śabdādhikāra, and Mandūkapluti-type exceptions.",
      "Meaning and Application": "The paribhāṣā apekṣāto'dhikāraḥ asserts that the initiation (pravṛtti) and cessation (nivṛtti) of an adhikāra (governing term or domain of application) are determined based on apekṣā—contextual necessity or relevance. The paribhāṣā is introduced to counter any presumption that a jñāpaka (explicit indicator) must always be present to activate or terminate an adhikāra. Hemahansagaṇi, in Nyāyasaṅgraha, illustrates this with examples from his own Haima tradition, where the influence of asatpare (from sūtra H 2/1/60) extends only up to rātsaḥ (H 2/170), and syādvidhau ca terminates at nomyādibhyaḥ (H 2/1/77). These boundaries are determined not through explicit jñāpakas but from contextual necessity alone."

      "source": "The primary jñāpaka cited is “ad vyañjane” (2.1.35), which does not explicitly mention sthānī (the replaced item). Hemahansagaṇi argues that if the term idam in ṣaṣṭhī is considered as sthānī, then by the rule “ṣaṣṭhyantyasya” (7.4.106), only the final letter ‘m’ should be replaced. But empirical usage shows that the entire idam is replaced by ‘a’, suggesting that idam is actually treated as prathamā. This conclusion justifies the application of the paribhāṣā to explain the shift in vibhakti due to artha, even though a formal jñāpaka is absent. He further supports this from the rule “anaka” (2.1.36), where the word idam is qualified by the prathamā-vibhakti word anaka, suggesting a transformation from ṣaṣṭhī to prathamā. The same kind of semantic adjustment is also seen in “tṛtīyasya pañcame” (1.3.1) and “tato haś caturthaḥ” (1.3.3), where instead of assuming a transformation from tṛtīyā, the word tataḥ is explicitly used, showing the selective and non-eternal (anitya) application of this paribhāṣā.",
      "historicity": "Vyādi in his Paribhāṣāsūcana (63) articulates this paribhāṣā as a context-sensitive rule: artham abhisamīkṣya... arthavaśāt. He provides the example: “uccaiḥ gṛhāṇi devadattasya āmantrayasva enam”, where devadattasya (originally ṣaṣṭhī) changes to enam (dvitīyā) because the meaning demands it. Vyādi further illustrates that in the sūtra “āṅo nā’striyām” (7.3.120), the term gheraḥ, although originally in ṣaṣṭhī, is semantically transformed to pañcamī because of its function in the sentence. He also notes that the tṛtīyā anuvṛtti from “saha supā” (2.1.4) is implied in “sup pratīnā mātrārthe” (2.1.9) despite not being explicitly stated, showing how case-shifts depend on artha. Purūṣottama in his Laghuparibhāṣāvṛtti (88) considers this rule as lokataḥ siddha. He gives the same examples as Vyādi and illustrates how ataḥ in pañcamī transforms to ṣaṣṭhī in “āne muk” (7.2.82), suggesting that semantic necessity overrides formal anuvṛtti. Śīradeva in Bṛhatparibhāṣāvṛtti (120) reiterates the view that this paribhāṣā is lokasiddha and rooted in everyday linguistic practice. He also connects this principle to the interpretive tradition, citing the Mahābhāṣya’s dictum: “yām kāñcid vibhaktim āśrayitum buddhiḥ upajāyate sā sā āśrayitavyā” — one may choose the case that seems appropriate based on the context. Jainendra’s Paribhāṣāvṛtti (34) offers a concise formulation: if syntactic coherence is not achievable without case transformation, then the transformation must be permitted based on artha. The Mahābhāṣya also implicitly supports this paribhāṣā through its emphasis on semantic appropriateness. In the discussion under “sthānivad ādeśo’ nalvidhau” (1.1.56), it is affirmed that grammatical rules are to serve the meaning, not contradict it.",
      "observation": "This paribhāṣā functions as a flexible tool when mechanical anuvṛtti does not suffice. It is invoked primarily to preserve semantic integrity where formal case endings fail to establish syntactic compatibility. However, its non-eternality (anityatva) is crucial. As Hemahansagaṇi and Vyādi note, this paribhāṣā is applicable only when no explicit instruction is given by the sūtrakāra. If the sūtrakāra deliberately uses words like tataḥ, as in “tato haś caturthaḥ”, the paribhāṣā becomes inapplicable. Lāvaṇyasūri, commenting on this in the Nyāyasamuccaya, adds that such nyāyas cannot override sūtras or render their wording redundant. He suggests that jñāpaka-siddha nyāyas should be seen as anitya if they conflict with explicit pāṇinian construction. However, this position becomes problematic when compared with his earlier acceptance of bhūtapūrvakaḥ nyāya’s implication of ṣṇām as a redundant plural — an internal inconsistency that challenges his own epistemological hierarchy. Further, Lāvaṇyasūri and others such as Purūṣottama admit that this paribhāṣā is absent from core pāṇinian texts like Paribhāṣenduśekhara, although it is found in ancient sources such as Vyādi and Śīradeva. Its omission in Pāṇinian codification is explained by its perceived lokasiddhatva — it is so evident in usage that it does not require formal inclusion.",
      "conclusion": "The paribhāṣā “arthavaśād vibhakti-pariṇāmaḥ” offers a meaningful intervention in grammatical interpretation where formal rules do not accommodate the semantic function of a word. Rooted in both usage (loka) and interpretive logic, it is recognized across schools though not always explicitly listed in Pāṇinian traditions. Hemahansagaṇi’s usage and justification reflect this broader interpretive flexibility. The rule remains non-eternal, applicable only when the sūtrakāra does not provide explicit structural markers. Its legitimacy stems from semantic coherence, not formal structure — echoing the core spirit of the paribhāṣā tradition to privilege meaning over mechanical rule-following.",
      "Meaning and Application": "The paribhāṣā “arthavaśād vibhakti-pariṇāmaḥ” postulates that the change or transformation of a case-ending (vibhakti) can occur on the basis of semantic necessity (artha). The term pariṇāma is glossed by Hemahansagaṇi as parāvartaḥ, indicating reversal or transformation. This transformation allows a word that originally occurs in one case (e.g., ṣaṣṭhī) to appear in another case (e.g., pañcamī or dvitīyā) in a later rule, even though formal rules of anuvṛtti might not permit such change. Hemahansagaṇi illustrates this with the example of the sūtra “ata āḥ syādau jasbhyāmye” (1.4.1), where the sixth-case-ending word ataḥ is carried forward into the subsequent sūtra “bhis ais” (1.4.2), but functionally appears in the pañcamī case. This phenomenon is explained not by formal grammatical rules alone but by the semantic necessity to maintain contextual coherence."

      "source": "The primary source of this rule in the Haimavyākaraṇa tradition is the Nyāyasaṅgraha of Hemahansagaṇi, which reads: arthavadgrahaṇe nānarthakasya (Nyāyasaṅgraha, 14)[cite: 561, 562]. The nyāya is also supported by the sūtra “tīyaṃ ṅitkārye vā” (H. 1.4.14), where the tīya affix applies only when semantically relevant. Similarly, in the case of verbal roots like han in plīhānau, the form is meaningless, and the expected transformation based on “inhan pūṣāryamṇaḥ śisyoḥ” (H. 1.4.87) is blocked due to the lack of semantic substance, leading instead to application of “ni dīrghaḥ” (H. 1.4.85). Hemahansagaṇi gives the further example from H. 1.4.38: tṛ-svasṛ-naptr̥-neṣṭr̥-tvaṣṭr̥-kṣatr̥-hotṛ-potr̥-praśāstro-ghutyār (H. 1.4.38). Here, the suffix tṛ is considered to be an unādisuffix and thus anarthaka. The special mention of words like naptr̥—which already end in tṛ—would be redundant unless the paribhāṣā were operative to exclude anarthaka tṛ endings. Hence, the sūtra becomes a jñāpaka (indicatory statement) for this paribhāṣā.",
      "historicity": "Pūruṣottama (in Paribhāṣāvṛtti) views this paribhāṣā as a nyāyasiddha, not dependent on any particular sūtra. He illustrates this through examples like dādhā-dhvadāp (P. 1.1.20), where dā and dhā are meaningful roots and hence valid objects of grammatical operation, while the etymological fragments from dāśu or dhāvu are not. He similarly explains śe (P. 1.1.13), where meaningful prātipadika suffixes (sup) are taken, not meaningless parts like ka in kaśe. By contrast, Śīradeva in his Bṛhatparibhāṣāvṛtti recognizes that Pūruṣottama’s inclusion of meaningless stems like dāśu or kaśe is controversial and not acceptable to all commentators. Śīradeva supports the paribhāṣā using the Mahābhāṣya discussion on “svam rūpam śabdasya” (P. 1.1.68), where the explicit mention of rūpa is seen as jñāpaka for the paribhāṣā, since semantic specification (artha) is intentionally excluded due to its non-operability in grammatical processes. Nāgeśa, while not explicitly classifying the paribhāṣā as nyāyasiddha or jñāpakasiddha, strongly supports its doctrinal necessity in his commentary to P. 1.1.68, where he states that in grammar, rules operate on śabda (form) and not artha (meaning), and the mention of svam rūpam is to exclude all semantic considerations in rule-triggering.",
      "observation": "This paribhāṣā is widely accepted across grammatical traditions. Vyādi begins his paribhāṣā list with this rule, establishing its foundational importance. In the Bṛhatparibhāṣāvṛtti, Śīradeva reaffirms its pervasiveness, citing applications in contexts like brashvabhrajādi-sūtra (P. 8.2.36), inhan pūṣāryamṇaḥ śisyoḥ (H. 1.4.87), and vārcādibhrajayoḥ. Durgasiṃha, commenting on the Kātantra paribhāṣā-sūtravṛtti, also supports this paribhāṣā, citing the necessity of excluding formal but anarthaka endings, such as in tejasvī where īn triggers elongation only if it is meaningful. Haribhāskara Agnihotri, in his Paribhāṣābhāskara, connects this paribhāṣā with broader issues of suffix classification and derivational integrity. He references the Manoramā, where complications due to suffix similarities could lead to overapplication unless this rule is accepted. For example, in cases like vṛttigraṇthānādaraḥ, improper derivation could emerge if anarthaka elements are treated like their meaningful counterparts. Finally, the Mahābhāṣya confirms the intent of this paribhāṣā when it comments on svam rūpam śabdasya aśabdasanjñā (P. 1.1.68). Patanjali emphasizes that grammar must operate on phonetic form (śabda) rather than semantics, and hence the rule arthavadgrahaṇe nānarthakasya serves to prevent the overextension of grammatical operations to semantically irrelevant elements.",
      "conclusion": "The paribhāṣā arthavadgrahaṇe nānarthakasya is a foundational rule that safeguards grammatical precision by restricting rule application only to meaningful elements, especially when identical or near-identical meaningless counterparts exist. It is universally acknowledged across grammatical traditions, treated as either nyāyasiddha (by Pūruṣottama and implicitly by Nāgeśa) or jñāpakasiddha (by Śīradeva and Vyādi). Its presence is vital in preventing errors in derivation caused by structural similarities, as repeatedly observed in the Haimavyākaraṇa sūtras as well as in other grammatical schools. The widespread acknowledgement and necessity of this paribhāṣā across classical commentaries affirm its centrality in Sanskrit grammatical theory.",
      "Meaning and Application": "The paribhāṣā “arthavadgrahaṇe nānarthakasya” lays down the principle that when a meaningful (arthavat) element is to be taken into consideration in a grammatical operation, a similar but meaningless (anarthaka) element must be excluded. The need for this rule arises due to the homophony or formal similarity between meaningful and meaningless elements—particularly affixes or stems—that can otherwise lead to erroneous grammatical applications. For example, in the word dvītīyaḥ, the affix tīya is meaningful, and its grammatical effect is validated by the rule “tīyaṃ ṅitkārye vā” (P. 1.4.14). However, in words like jātīyaḥ (as in paṭujātīyaḥ), the tīya is only formally similar and not semantically operative ; hence it is excluded from the application of the same sūtra. This paribhāṣā prevents overextension of grammatical rules to such similar-looking, yet grammatically inert, forms."

      "source": "Hemahansagaṇi provides multiple examples to justify this rule. He explains that in Haima sūtras like “no’praśāno’nusvārānunāsikau ca pūrvasya adhuṭpare” (H 1.3.8), although the na could be inferred from general rules (like “tau mu” H 1.3.14), such inference (lakṣaṇika) is not accepted where direct mention (pratipadokta) is present, such as “no’ntaḥ” (H 8.3.36). Similarly, in bahuvrīhi compounds, even though general compounding is prescribed in “ekārthaṁ cānekam ca” (H 2.1.22), still the separate prescription in “āsannādūrādhikādhyarddhārddhādipūraṇaṁ dvitīyādya-nyārthe” (H 2.1.20) is considered pratipadokta and must be preferred. Nāgeśa, in Paribhāṣenduśekhara, supports this reading and identifies its fundamental cause as śīghropasthitikatva—the immediacy of appearance or cognition of the rule. He also affirms its application to varṇagrahaṇa based on Mahābhāṣya’s comments on “ot” (P.6.1.45), rejecting objections that claim the paribhāṣā doesn’t apply to individual letters. The Mahābhāṣya itself reinforces this view by emphasizing that when both gauṇa (secondary) and mukhya (primary) meanings are possible, one must default to mukhya. In the discussion on “ot”, it is stated explicitly that in such conflicts, “na bhaviṣyati”—the rule will not proceed on the basis of lakṣaṇika forms, and “arthāśraya etad evaṁ bhavati ” —one must base the rule on what is explicitly grounded in meaning, not inference.",
      "historicity": "This paribhāṣā is attested in both Haima and Pāṇinian traditions but is not accepted as nitya (universal). Both Nāgeśa and Hemahansagaṇi acknowledge exceptions to its applicability. Nāgeśa comments on its anityatva using the example of “bhuvaśca mahāvyāhṛteḥ” (P.8.1.72), where the term mahāvyāhṛti is introduced precisely to exclude the lakṣaṇika plural bhuvaḥ. Since the form would not have been included anyway via the rule due to its lakṣaṇikatva, its explicit exclusion reflects the limited validity of the paribhāṣā and the need for precision. Hemahansagaṇi, too, points out that in forms like he karttaḥ (vocative), the tṛ in kartṛ is pratipadokta via “ṇakatṛcau” (H 5.1.48), while in niṣkauśāmbiḥ, the short i is derived indirectly from the long ī of kauśāmbī via “goścānte” (H .2.4.96), thus qualifying as lakṣaṇika. Only the former is governed by the rule, demonstrating the operational limits of lakṣaṇika derivations. Interestingly, Hemahansagaṇi also discusses the uṇādi derivation of ahan (day), showing how the form ahan meaning “day” is derived by direct naming from the uṇādi-sūtra “śvanmātariśvan-” (uṇādi 902) and is thus pratipadokta, while the verb-form ahan from han + divi is lakṣaṇika due to being derived through markers (cihna). The latter is not eligible for replacement under “ahnaḥ ruḥ” (P.6.4.74).",
      "observation": "All commentaries surveyed—Hemahansagaṇi, Nāgeśa, and the Mahābhāṣya—unanimously affirm the superiority of pratipadokta over lakṣaṇika in situations of dual eligibility. However, each also warns against overextension of this rule. Nāgeśa calls it anityā and critiques interpretations that exclude its relevance to letters (varṇas), referring to the Mahābhāṣya’s application of this paribhāṣā in the context of ot (P.6.1.45). He explicitly refutes the idea (found in Śabdenduśekhara) that upadeśa-based rules automatically preclude this nyāya. Hemahansagaṇi systematically presents multiple cases across levels—samāsa, pratyaya, sup/tiṅ-endings, and even uṇādi derivations—to illustrate the boundaries between lakṣaṇika and pratipadokta. His example of priyadaśānaḥ versus āsannadaśāḥ shows that even within the same compound type, the derivation method can trigger or block a suffix depending on whether the component was explicitly stated.",
      "conclusion": "The paribhāṣā “lakṣaṇapratipadoktayor pratipadoktasyaiva grahaṇam” stands as a vital interpretative tool for distinguishing direct grammatical authority (pratipadokti) from inferred authority (lakṣaṇikatva). Though upheld across grammatical traditions, its non-universal applicability is clearly recognized. The examples from bahuvrīhi compounds, vocative formations, and uṇādi derivations strongly demonstrate the paribhāṣā’s scope and limitations. The rule is not listed as a Haimaka-sūtra but is affirmed in Nyāyasaṅgraha as a nyāya and supported with strong reasoning by Nāgeśa and Patañjali. The preference for pratipadokta arises not only from interpretative immediacy (śīghropasthiti) but from grammatical clarity and derivational validity.",
      "Meaning and Application": "This paribhāṣā asserts that in cases where both lakṣaṇika (meaning derived from inference or general indication) and pratipadokta (meaning directly stated word-by-word) are possible, only the pratipadokta should be accepted. The term lakṣaṇa refers to that which indicates something, i.e., liṅga or sign. A rule established via such a sign is called lakṣaṇika by upacāra (figurative usage). In contrast, a rule stated explicitly for each individual word (padam padam prati uktam) is called pratipadokta. When both are available, preference must be given to the pratipadokta, as it is more immediate and reliable. This principle applies across different grammatical processes like samāsa formation, affixation, or substitution, and even in decisions involving letter-level phenomena in some traditions."

      "source": "The source of this nyāya is indicated by the employment of the term rājan in the sūtra rājansakheḥ (H 7.3.106). It serves as a gender-distinctive marker. In the feminine form rājñī, there is no n ending ; therefore, to negate the at affix in compound words, the term rājan has been specifically used. To prevent this, the masculine base rājan is specifically chosen, thereby indicating that the paribhāṣā does not apply universally but admits of exceptions. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri emphasises this limitation by pointing to another sūtra striyām (H 3.2.69), which, by independently governing feminine derivations, signals that the current paribhāṣā is not nitya (universally applicable) but context-dependent. Nandighoṣavijaya reinforces this by aligning with the rājan/rājñī contrast, illustrating how the use of masculine forms in Haima sūtras was intentional to restrict suffixation in feminine compounds. In the Pāṇinian tradition, Nāgeśabhaṭṭa provides a jñāpaka: the juxtaposition of kumāraḥ śramaṇādibhiḥ (P 2.1.70), where the masculine kumāra is placed alongside feminine śramaṇā and others. Since their gender conflict precludes natural sāmānādhikaraṇya, the use of the masculine form in the presence of feminine compounds is superfluous unless it signals that kumāra includes kumārī. This superfluity becomes an indicator (jñāpaka) for the inclusion of gendered variants under the masculine base. The rule is codified in Vyādi’s Paribhāṣāsūcana as “prātipadikagrahaṇe liṅgaviśiṣṭasya’pi grahaṇam” (No. 25), where the same kumāraḥ śramaṇādibhiḥ sūtra is used as evidence. Vyādi argues that since the compound occurs between kumāra (masculine) and śramaṇā (feminine), their agreement in case requires the acceptance of feminine forms under the prātipadika kumāra. He further points to yuvā khalatipalitavālinjaratībhiḥ (P 2.1.67) as a jñāpaka showing the same interpretative need: in absence of this paribhāṣā, the compound yuvā jaratī would be semantically inconsistent. Śīradeva in Bṛhatparibhāṣāvṛtti closely follows this reasoning. He acknowledges that without this paribhāṣā, the compound yuvā jaratī, combining semantically incompatible terms, would not be possible. But by interpreting jaratī as sharing the underlying referential domain of yuvā (youth), albeit metaphorically or contextually (due to shared lack of restlessness or agility), the compound is justified. Śīradeva considers this a case of abhidhānopacāra (extension of reference through semantic transfer), which the paribhāṣā allows. Pūruṣottamadeva offers perhaps the most exhaustive list of applications for this paribhāṣā across sūtra domains. According to him, it enables gendered inclusion in pronominal case constructions (sarvanāmnastṛtīyā ca, P 2.3.27), accent rules (kusūlabilam), tatpuruṣa compounds (putrasadṛśī), taddhita derivations (hastinī-mātram), lopa rules (rājñyāḥ puruṣaḥ), alug constraints (grāmevāsinī), puṃvadbhāva in evaluative derivations (darśanīyamaninī), exclusion rules in samāsānta suffixes (bahuśreyasī), and even in upacāra cases where semantic domain shifts justify form inclusion (ayaskumbhī). Importantly, he attributes this paribhāṣā to Kātyāyana as a supplementary statement under P. 4.1.1 (vārtikas 4 and 5), implying its formal derivation from ancient grammatical authority. Mahābhāṣya too treats this paribhāṣā in considerable depth under the sūtra ṅyāpprātipadikāt (P 1.2.75). There, Patañjali identifies nine domains of application for this rule: pronominal usage, accentuation, compounding, suffixation, lug/alug, evaluative semantics, derivational analogies, suffix blocking, and semantic extension. For example, in the sentence bhavatyā hetunā, the feminine bhavatī receives instrumental case marking by virtue of this paribhāṣā. Similarly, putrasadṛśī as a compound becomes valid due to the inclusion of feminine forms within the masculine sadṛśa. The Mahābhāṣya explicitly rejects the alternative “liṅgaviśiṣṭagrahaṇe prātipadikasya’pi grahaṇam,” arguing that such a reversal fails to explain why masculine stems like rājan are specifically chosen in sūtras to prevent feminine over-extension. Śīradeva also notes a potential objection: if masculine includes feminine via this rule, then in cases like diteḥ apatyam or chatakāyā āirak, how do we block undesired extensions? He resolves this by noting the presence of vṛddhi-rules or phonetic transformations which serve to differentiate intended forms. Moreover, he emphasises that this rule is only operative where abhidhāna (linguistic expression) and abhidheya (referent) can align under semantic or pragmatic appropriateness.",
      "historicity": "The provenance of this paribhāṣā can be traced to early metarule formulations. Kātyāyana’s vārtikas under P. 4.1.1 are the earliest textual instantiations. The Mahābhāṣya clearly accepts the rule’s validity, but also affirms its anityatva (contextual limitation). Both Śīradeva and Pūruṣottama underscore this limited scope, often by pointing to specific counterexamples: mahati-priyā, madra-rājñī, or the blocking of ṭac in mahārājñī—cases where suffixation fails despite gendered inclusion. These instances show that the rule operates within a selective syntactic and morphological horizon. Its rejection as a universal maxim is thus deeply rooted in both the Haima and Pāṇinian commentarial traditions.",
      "observation": "The nuanced treatment of this paribhāṣā across traditions reveals its dual role: as a hermeneutic bridge for grammatical inference and as a boundary-defining mechanism for rule application. The tension between inclusion and exclusion, literal and upacāra-based meanings, underlies much of its interpretive richness. Both Haima and Pāṇinian traditions maintain a shared view of its anityatva, albeit with different jñāpakas. This consensus, however, allows for plural applications in practical derivations—be it hastinikam from hastinī or kumarīyati via semantic extension from kumāra. Although Hemaḥaṃsagaṇi provides an example of the anityatva of this paribhāṣā, he does not explicitly mention a jñāpaka for it. Nandighoṣavijaya highlights this absence and proposes that the sūtra striyām (H 3.2.69) as cited by Vijayalāvaṇyasūri serves as the jñāpaka for this anityatva. The reasoning is that, in the derivation of a ṣaṣṭhī-tatpuruṣa compound like mahākaraḥ, the suffix ḍā would typically be added to the base mahat using the sūtra mahataḥ kara-ghāsa-viśiṣṭe ḍā (H 3.2.68). If the paribhāṣā were universally applicable, then the feminine form mahatī should have also been included in the scope of this rule, allowing for ḍā-affixation directly. However, the existence of a separate sūtra striyām (H 3.2.69) to assign ḍā in the feminine indicates that this paribhāṣā does not apply uniformly and hence is anitya .Nandighoṣavijaya contests this interpretation. He argues that striyām (H 3.2.69) was introduced not to signal the anityatva of the paribhāṣā, but because the earlier sūtra (H 3.2.68) allowed only vikalpa (optional) application of ḍā, while in the context of striyām, the application is nitya (obligatory). Thus, a separate rule is necessary for expressing nityatva, and its presence does not disqualify the general applicability of the paribhāṣā. Further, he quotes the Siddhahema-bṛhadvṛtti of Hemacandra himself, where it is explicitly stated that the rule nāmagrahaṇe liṅgaviśiṣṭasya’pi grahaṇam is already established by the preceding paribhāṣā and hence this sūtra (striyām) does not act as a jñāpaka for its anityatva. Consequently, Nandighoṣavijaya calls for an alternative jñāpaka to substantiate the anityatva of the paribhāṣā.",
      "conclusion": "The paribhāṣā “Nāmagrahaṇe liṅgaviśiṣṭasya’pi grahaṇam” functions as a foundational tool to generalise derivational operations across gendered variants of a nominal base. While it grants flexibility in applying case-endings, compounds, and suffixes to feminine and neuter forms, it also admits of deliberate exceptions, many of which are codified through distinct sūtras or accentual constraints. Its jñāpakas across Haima and Pāṇinian traditions, such as rājan, kumāra, or yuvā, not only exemplify its usage but also mark its boundaries. Far from being a rigid doctrine, this rule reflects the adaptability and discretion inherent in Sanskrit grammatical reasoning. The dispute over the jñāpaka of anityatva reveals an important interpretive difference even within the Haima tradition. While Vijayalāvaṇyasūri identifies striyām (H 3.2.69) as a jñāpaka of the paribhāṣā’s anityatva, Nandighoṣavijaya rejects this reading, asserting that the sūtra was needed for nityatva rather than as a restriction. His citation of the Siddhahema-bṛhadvṛtti strengthens this claim. This internal debate underscores the critical need for grammarians to determine the universal applicability or inapplicability of paribhāṣā. Additionally, this exchange helps differentiate between optional and nitya application of a sūtra in the affixation process.",
      "Meaning and Application": "This paribhāṣā asserts that when a grammatical sūtra includes the term “prātipadika” or “nāma”, it should be interpreted as encompassing gender-inflected forms (liṅgaviśiṣṭa) of the word as well. In other words, the sūtra’s operation is not limited to the unmarked (masculine or default) form but extends to all gender-specific forms derived from the base. It serves as an interpretative rule for extending the referent of a grammatical term beyond its overt masculine base to also include its feminine and neuter counterparts when semantically or syntactically relevant. In effect, when a sūtra employs a masculine noun stem (e.g., kumāra, rājan, kumbha), this rule allows for the inclusion of its gender-marked forms like kumārī, rājñī, or kumbhī, even though their surface phonological forms differ. This extension, however, is not without constraint. The rule does not universally override context-sensitive conditions, especially in sūtras where gender-specific forms are used to exclude other genders."

    "text": {
      "source": "As per Hemahansagaṇi, the source or jñāpaka of this paribhāṣā is the sūtra “ekasvarād anusvāretaḥ” (H 4.4.56). The need for the ekasvarāt qualifier in this sūtra is questioned: most dhātus like kṛ are inherently ekasvara (single-vowel) and thus the operation could have been performed even if only anusvāretaḥ was stated. The mention of ekasvarāt becomes justified only when one considers the inclusion of yaṅluganta roots like carkṛ, which, due to reduplication, become anekasvara (multi-vowel). In such cases, if only anusvāretaḥ were stated, then yaṅluganta forms would have been wrongly blocked by it-substitution rules, invalidating desired forms such as carkarita. To safeguard against this, the extended form ekasvarād anusvāretaḥ is employed, thus indirectly suggesting the application of root-specific rules even to yaṅluganta forms. However, this identification of the jñāpaka is contested. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri explicitly denies the sufficiency of ekasvarāt as a proper jñāpaka, asserting that a jñāpaka must retain independent meaning beyond the immediate context and must function elsewhere too. Since ekasvarāt serves no other evident purpose, its role as a jñāpaka is questionable. Further, in Siddhemahṛdaya’s own Br̥hadvṛtti, it is stated that the sūtra was crafted only to ensure regularity (nityārtham idam), not to establish any novel inference.",
      "historicity": "The paribhāṣā is explicitly cited by Hemahansagaṇi in Nyāyasaṅgraha and accepted within the Haimavyākaraṇa tradition. However, commentators differ in their assessment of its status. Nandighoṣavijaya mentions that the paribhāṣā seems nityasiddha, i.e., logically self-evident, and thus may not require a separate jñāpaka. He further critiques the overreliance on ekasvarāt anusvāretaḥ as an indicator. He presents a counter-example involving vadh, an anekasvara root derived from han, suggesting that if the purpose of the sūtra was to prevent iṭ-substitution solely for vadh, then a different sūtra would have sufficed (avadhānusvāretaḥ). The generalized construction of the sūtra hints at a broader aim, which supports the logic of the paribhāṣā. Śīradeva, while accepting the paribhāṣā, acknowledges that it is not cited in the Mahābhāṣya. He presents vid + yaṅ = veved as an example and says that forms like vevidati are derived due to this paribhāṣā. He explains the mechanism through ṣaṣṭhī-dvitva logic (where reduplicated forms are treated as identical in grammatical inheritance). Still, he questions the sufficiency of jñāpaka status for the cited sūtra. Nāgeśa Bhaṭṭa provides the strongest critique. In Paribhāṣenduśekhara, he examines this paribhāṣā and the example han + yaṅ → jajghana. He refutes the need for such a paribhāṣā by arguing that the application of grammatical rules to yaṅluganta forms is not grounded in textual authority but inferred from examples like jajghana. He states: “tad api na, bhāṣye adarśanāt” — this rule is not supported by the Mahābhāṣya. He further argues that although the reduplicated elements (like ja in jajghana) preserve the sense of the original root (han), the collective unit (jajghana) cannot be called prakṛti. Moreover, since the Mahābhāṣya is silent on this, one must not assume that all yaṅluganta formations automatically qualify as prakṛti. Hence, Nāgeśa does not accept the paribhāṣā, and this amounts to an implicit rejection. Haribhāskara supports the application of this paribhāṣā in explaining the validity of forms like veddeti alongside vedeti, aligning himself with Mādhavācārya, who interprets the form jāgrahītā in accordance with the sūtra “graho’liṭi dīrghaḥ” (P.7.2.37). He explicitly accepts this position and refutes the alternative explanation provided by BhaṭṭoDīkṣita, who attribute the lengthening (dīrgha) in such cases to “ekāco dve prathamasya” (P.6.1.1). Haribhāskara argues that this view contradicts the Bhāṣya, referencing Kaiyaṭa’s interpretation of “graher aṅgāt” where the dīrgha is due to the aṅga nature of the root grah, not merely due to descriptive or semantic strength (viśeṣaṇa-sāmarthya). He thus deems the Dīkṣita view as grammatically unsound .Haribhāskara dismisses Haradatta’s interpretation of the sūtra “ekāco dve prathamasya” where the term ekāc is said to carry over into the rule “graho’liṭi dīrghaḥ”. He strongly argues that such a carryover would violate the restrictions explicitly listed in the vartika: “ṣṭipā śapānubandhena nirdiṣṭaṁ yad gaṇena ca, yatraikājgrahaṇaṁ caiva pañcaitāni na yaṅlupi । ” According to this, if such an extension were allowed, dīrgha would improperly apply in yaṅluganta forms, which the vartika explicitly prohibits. In his analysis of the jñāpaka for this paribhāṣā, Haribhāskara supports the use of the sūtra “ūd upadhāyā gohaḥ” (P.6.4.89) as an indicator. He disputes the view of Śīradeva, who argued that the upadhā-grahaṇa should instead have been made in the following sūtra “gamahanajanakhanaghasām” (P.6.4.98) to prevent alontyasya lopaḥ. Haribhāskara responds that, from the perspective of those who accept jñāpaka-vāda, it is sufficient to treat the term ataḥ in that rule as referring to a sthānī (replacement), thus maintaining the meaningful role of upadhā-grahaṇa in the earlier sūtra. He defends the placement of the jñāpaka in the earlier rule by citing the Yaṅluganta-śiromaṇi, which supports his stance: “ uttarārtham upadhāgrahaṇaṁ cedu tatratraiva kariṣyata iti ”, meaning that if the upadhāgrahaṇa were intended for the later rule, it would have been used there. Haribhāskara’s overall position thus accepts the paribhāṣā’s applicability to yaṅluganta forms, particularly in cases involving dīrgha and upadhā-related operations, while systematically refuting readings by Haradatta, Dīkṣita scholars, and Śīradeva that are either inconsistent with the Bhāṣya or conflict with the vartikas. His agreement with Mādhavācārya and endorsement of the jñāpaka from “ūd upadhāyā gohaḥ” underscore his alignment with a Bhāṣya-consistent and nyāya-supported interpretive framework. Vyādi also seems to accept the logic of the paribhāṣā through the application of upadhāgrahaṇa in the sūtra ūdupadhāyā gohaḥ (6.4.89), arguing that if a rule applies to a root with a specific vowel (like ū), and the yaṅluganta form contains this vowel due to reduplication, the rule should still apply. This justifies the use of prakṛti even in reduplicated roots.",
      "observation": "The paribhāṣā is logically coherent but lacks uniform support across traditions. In the Haimavyākaraṇa school, it is accepted and justified either through analogy or the inferred need for rule extension. Hemahansagaṇi and Nandighoṣavijaya both provide grammatical motivation. However, mainstream Pāṇinian authorities like Nāgeśa, and to a lesser extent Śīradeva, challenge its textual legitimacy. Nāgeśa’s silence of the Bhāṣya and rejection of the jñāpaka make the rule suspect in terms of formal applicability. Yet, its widespread use in modern derivations, as Haribhāskara notes, compels practical acceptance.",
      "conclusion": "The paribhāṣā “prakṛtigrahaṇe yaṅlugantasya’pi grahaṇam” functions as a logical extension within the Haimavyākaraṇa system, ensuring that grammatical rules applicable to verbal roots extend seamlessly to their reduplicated forms. While the sūtra ekasvarād anusvāretaḥ is cited as a jñāpaka by Hemahansagaṇi, this identification is rejected by later Haimic commentators like Vijayalāvaṇyasūri due to lack of universal applicability. Nāgeśa explicitly challenges the legitimacy of this paribhāṣā, noting the absence of support in the Mahābhāṣya. Despite these objections, the paribhāṣā remains prevalent across grammatical traditions due to its utility in practice, and thus finds inclusion in all major paribhāṣā collections. Its ultimate acceptance rests more on practical necessity and logical coherence than on explicit textual authority.",
      "Meaning and Application": "The term prakṛti denotes the base form from which a grammatical operation (such as affixation) is triggered. Prakṛti can be of two types: nominal (nāma) or verbal (dhātu). In the context of this paribhāṣā, only the verbal root (dhātu) form is relevant, as yaṅluganta formations pertain exclusively to verbal derivations. The core assertion of this paribhāṣā is that wherever a grammatical rule is prescribed for a simple verbal root (dhātu), it may also be extended to apply to its yaṅluganta counterpart, i.e., a reduplicated verb with affixes like yaṅ or lug. For example, in the derivation of praṇidatte, the root dāg triggers the replacement of ni by ṇi through the sūtra “ner ṅbahā dāpvat” (H 2.3.79). The same substitution is asserted to be valid even when the root is in its yaṅluganta form. Thus, even with a base like praṇidad, the form praṇidādeti is generated by the same operation. This broadens the scope of prakṛtigrahaṇa to include yaṅluganta roots in the domain of rules that otherwise target simple roots."

      "source": "Within the Haima tradition, the explicit formulation of this paribhāṣā in the Nyāyasaṅgraha of Hemahansagaṇi is itself a key source. Hemahansagaṇi does not merely assert the rule but illustrates each of its five components with direct references to authoritative sūtras (e.g., na kavater yaṅaḥ, ṇepibaḥ pīpya, gāpāsthāsādāmāhākaḥ, ṛtpañcakācchidayaḥ, ekasvarād anusvāretaḥ). In his view, the inclusion of tivādi-nirdiṣṭa rules in the sūtras would otherwise be inexplicable unless such an exception rule (this paribhāṣā) existed. Thus, the sūtras that use tiv, śav, and so on, act as jñāpaka-s for this paribhāṣā. In the Pāṇinian tradition, although this paribhāṣā does not occur in Vyādi’s or Śākaṭāyana’s compilations, it is indirectly supported by the Mahābhāṣya. Nandighoṣavijaya asserts that this paribhāṣā is indeed bhāṣyāviruddha and interprets its legitimacy based on detailed readings of ekāc upadeśe’ nudāttāt (P. 7.2.10) and related bhāṣya passages. He acknowledges that this rule is not universally applicable and categorizes the tiv- and ekasvara-nirdiṣṭa portions as nitya (obligatory), while śav-, anubandha- and gaṇa-nirdiṣṭa as anitya due to sporadic applicability in yaṅluganta contexts. Nāgeśa Bhaṭṭa, in contrast, categorically rejects this paribhāṣā in his commentary on Paribhāṣenduśekhara. His argument is grounded in multiple pramāṇas. He begins by questioning the purpose of restricting derivational rules in yaṅluganta forms using this paribhāṣā when many of those operations—like the iṭ-nivṛtti governed by ekāc upadeśe —are already managed by existing sūtras. He further points out that the supposed defect in yaṅluganta forms such as bibhidite is not explicitly addressed in the bhāṣya and therefore should not be interpreted as needing a new rule. He reads the bhāṣya’s mention of yaṅlopaḥ as part of a generic closing statement rather than an active upasaṁhāra specific to yaṅluganta. He also observes that if this paribhāṣā were indeed accepted, then additional pramāṇas would be needed to explain the iṭ-pravṛtti and iṭ-nivṛtti in various forms, especially where the upadeśa is ambiguous, as in jāgaritavān. Moreover, Nāgeśa refutes the argument that the presence of tivādi-nirdiṣṭa terms in sūtras is inherently purposive for this paribhāṣā, instead interpreting them in a broader grammatical context without the need for restriction.",
      "historicity": "The absence of this paribhāṣā in earlier paribhāṣā collections such as those of Vyādi and Śākaṭāyana suggests its post-Pāṇinian or possibly medieval formulation. Hemahansagaṇi seems to have systematized this rule to address inconsistencies arising in yaṅluganta derivations, especially in the context of prakṛtigrahaṇa. Yet, the fact that it aligns with certain readings of the Mahābhāṣya (especially in examples like nṛttam, śāśakitaḥ, heyāt) makes it difficult to dismiss entirely. Nandighoṣavijaya recognizes this alignment with bhāṣya and accepts it as bhāṣyāviruddha, thus endorsing it as a legitimate interpretive rule. Conversely, Nāgeśa’s refutation illustrates the growing rationalist critique of proliferating paribhāṣās without unequivocal scriptural sanction. He demands a stricter standard of textual pramāṇa before accepting new exceptions.",
      "observation": "This paribhāṣā serves as a fine example of rule-based reasoning in Sanskrit grammar, where a general principle like prakṛtigrahaṇa is counterbalanced by contextual exceptions. Hemahansagaṇi’s formulation is supported by a network of sūtra-based examples. The fivefold classification reveals the extent to which yaṅluganta forms deviate from regular derivational rules, thereby necessitating a dedicated interpretive mechanism. The contrasting positions of Nāgeśa and Hemahansagaṇi underscore two opposing philosophical tendencies within vyākaraṇa: one striving for regulative simplicity, the other accommodating empirical anomalies through layered rule hierarchies. Nandighoṣavijaya provides a mediating position by partially accepting the paribhāṣā, distinguishing between its nitya and anitya components based on usage frequency. Viśvanātha Miśra agrees with the view of Nandighoṣavijaya and offers a critical rebuttal to Nāgeśa’s rejection of this paribhāṣā by reinterpreting the intent behind the sūtra ekāca upadeśe’nudāttāt (P.7.2.10). He argues that instead of this formulation, the sūtra interpretation should ideally be ajvat upadeśe’nudāttāt, since all roots marked with anudātta in the upadeśa are inherently ac-ending. In such a scenario, explicitly stating ac becomes superfluous, rendering the ac-grahaṇa redundant. This redundancy, he asserts, implies that the ekāc-term, being unnecessarily specific, inadvertently supports (jñāpaka) the validity of the paribhāṣā. Miśra highlights a methodological gap in the Bhāṣya itself: in the case of vebhiditā, a yaṅlopa form, the Bhāṣyakāra employs the principle of sthānivadbhāva to counter the potential flaw. However, for yaṅlug constructions, no such corrective device is provided. This absence, Miśra argues, implies the Bhāṣyakāra’s acceptance of iṭ-insertion in yaṅlug formations, which is best accounted for by this paribhāṣā. He maintains that the lack of iṭ-insertion in yaṅlug forms in conventional usage (loka) cannot be taken as conclusive pramāṇa. Rather than adopting strained or speculative interpretations to deny the paribhāṣā, Miśra advocates accepting it, even if its application results in occasional inconsistencies. Such inconsistencies, he contends, may be resolved by recognizing the optionality (anityatā) of the resulting forms—an idea already substantiated under the sūtra guṇo yaṅlukoḥ (P.7.4.82).",
      "conclusion": "The paribhāṣā “tivā śavānubandhena nirṇiṣṭaṁ yad gaṇena ca ekasvarinimittaṁ ca pañcaitāni na yaṅlupi” represents a sophisticated attempt within the Haima tradition to identify and limit the overapplication of grammatical rules in derived verbal forms. Though absent in early grammatical collections, its relevance in resolving inconsistencies in yaṅluganta derivations makes it a valuable contribution. Nāgeśa’s rigorous rejection forces the grammarian to examine the epistemological basis of such exceptions. Still, the rule’s consistency with several bhāṣya examples and the logic of derivational integrity lend strong support to its inclusion in the grammatical discourse. In the final analysis, its acceptance depends on whether one privileges historical-pragmatic coherence or strict textual fidelity. In this thesis, we accept Hemahansagaṇi’s position with Nandighoṣavijaya’s nuanced qualification, regarding the paribhāṣā as partially obligatory and partially optional, thereby aligning it with both the Haima tradition and the broader grammatical canon.",
      "Meaning and Application": "This paribhāṣā formulates an important exception to the preceding interpretive rule “prakṛtigrahaṇe yaṅlugantasya’pi grahaṇam” by specifying five categories of derivational operations that do not extend to yaṅluganta forms despite the general rule of prakṛtigrahaṇa. These five categories are: (1) operations specified by the presence of the suffix tiv (e.g., chātvakāra from ‘na kavater yaṅaḥ’) , (2) operations involving śav-vikaraṇa (as in ‘pibeti’ → ‘pibayati’) , (3) rules based on anubandha indications (as in ādeśa formation from a root like hāk indicated via anubandha) , (4) operations derived from gaṇa classifications (including subtypes like saṅkhyā-, ādi- and bahuvacana-nirdiṣṭa roots) , and (5) rules hinging upon ekasvara-nimitta such as vowel-based nasalization or augment inhibition (e.g., ekasvarād anusvāretaḥ). Hemahansagaṇi clearly delineates each of these categories with classical examples. For instance, in the tiv-nirdiṣṭa operation, he contrasts the derivation of kokūyate (where chātvakāra does not occur due to tiv) with cokvīti, a yaṅluganta form where the rule is not applicable due to the paribhāṣā. Similarly, in the case of śav-nirdiṣṭa rules such as pibeti → pīpya, Hemahansagaṇi explains how pib yields pīpya only in the presence of the root and not in its yaṅluganta form such as apāpayat. These examples underscore how this paribhāṣā negates the automatic application of derivational rules to yaṅluganta forms that would otherwise be predicted by the previous paribhāṣā of prakṛtigrahaṇa. Furthermore, the commentary clarifies that śav, anubandha, and gaṇa-based derivations are treated as anitya (non-obligatory) in the sense that exceptions occur within yaṅluganta. For example, although nis undergoes ṣatva in nissṭapati, such transformation does not take place in nistātpiṭi, where the verb is in a yaṅluganta form. Similarly, anubandha-based ādeśas like heyāt (from hāk) do not apply to jahāyāt, the yaṅluganta derivative of the same root. In terms of gaṇa-based rules, Hemahansagaṇi explains with extensive cases drawn from saṅkhyā, ādi, and bahuvacana-groups that rules like ṛtpañcakācchidayaḥ, dyutādi, and tergrahādibhyaḥ fail to apply in yaṅluganta contexts. In the fifth category, namely ekasvaranimitta, the rule ekasvarād anusvāretaḥ fails to prohibit iṭ-insertion in yaṅluganta words such as śāśakitaḥ, although it prohibits it in forms like śakt. Here, a tension arises since the base root śak is technically ekasvara, and by the earlier paribhāṣā it would be eligible for such derivation. However, Hemahansagaṇi explicitly restricts its application in yaṅluganta forms, thereby invoking this exception-paribhāṣā."

      "source": "According to Hemahansagaṇi, the jñāpaka of this nyāya is the intentional inclusion of the word anekasvarād in the sūtra (H 3.4.46). The broad reference to “multiple vowels” shows that although technically reduplication (ṇvā) creates anekasvaratva, the sūtra does not apply in papāca, suggesting that a sannipāta-vidhi cannot destroy its own nimitta. Nāgeśa, in Paribhāṣenduśekhara, explains that this paribhāṣā is supported by a laukika nyāya, a worldly maxim: opposing one’s own source of existence is inherently unjustified[cite: 833, 834]. When an operation is based on a sannipāta, it must preserve its cause. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri aligns with Nāgeśa and also sees the paribhāṣā as rooted in such maxim-based reasoning. However, Hemahansagaṇi presents an opposing laukika analogy, noting that in the worldly sphere a son, who is the effect, can indeed kill his father, who is the cause[cite: 836, 837]. The father, being the cause, produces the son as the effect, yet the son can still bring about the father’s cessation. However, Hemahansagaṇi clarifies that grammar does not function like the laukika world ; in grammar, the cause must remain intact even after the effect arises. This distinction highlights the unique logical framework of grammar, which this nyāya protects. Lāvanyasūri rejects the son-father analogy, arguing that in society, a son who harms his father is considered unworthy, and therefore such an example is inappropriate for a grammatical context. He insists instead that grammar mirrors the social principle that an effect does not typically destroy its cause. Thus, the jñāpaka of this nyāya is both textual and maxim-based, bridging the internal logic of grammar with broader philosophical reasoning.",
      "historicity": "This nyāya holds an important place in the historical evolution of Sanskrit grammar and is consistently attested across multiple traditions. In the Pāṇinian tradition, the Mahābhāṣya discusses it in depth under kṛnmejantaḥ (P 1.1.39) while addressing potential conflicts between sannipāta-driven operations such as vowel shortening (hrasvatva) and tuk-augmentation. Patanjali explains its necessity to avoid contradictions in derivations like grāmaṇi-kulam, śatāni, and ramāya, and lists its prayojanāni (practical uses), showing that the principle was already firmly established in his time. The Haima tradition also preserves the paribhāṣā. Hemahansagaṇi in Nyāyasaṅgraha uses it to clarify derivations such as papāca and explains its significance in protecting the nimitta of reduplication. Nandighoṣavijaya further elaborates on it with lucid laukika analogies, highlighting its logical basis as a safeguard against self-destruction of causes. Nāgeśa Bhaṭṭa, in Paribhāṣenduśekhara, refines the concept further by showing its scope not only for cause-effect relations but also for viśeṣya-viśeṣaṇa sannipāta (base-modifier relationships). Yet he also marks it as anitya (non-absolute), citing exceptional derivations like atijarasaiḥ, where the aiś-replacement destroys the adantatva of jara, yet the replacement still applies despite violating the paribhāṣā. Other grammatical traditions also acknowledge this principle. The Kātantra, Vyādi, and Śākāṭāyana schools include it in their paribhāṣā-saṅgrahas. Bhoja’s Śabdānuśāsana mentions a similar rule, showing its diffusion beyond the Pāṇinian framework. Thus, from Vyādi’s time to Nāgeśa, this nyāya appears as a shared and persistent interpretive tool, highlighting its pan-grammatical significance and historical depth.",
      "observation": "Although this nyāya is widely accepted, it is not universal in its application. Mahābhāṣya explicitly lists contexts where it preserves grammatical coherence, such as in grāmaṇi-kulam where neuter-shortening does not obstruct tuk, and in śatāni where the num-augmentation does not lead to luk. Nāgeśa acknowledges its necessity but also underlines its occasional inapplicability, as seen in atijarasaiḥ, where the aiś-replacement overrides the paribhāṣā. Hemahansagaṇi too admits its anityatva, pointing out cases where the nimitta is nullified but the operation still proceeds. Philosophical disagreements arise regarding its logical grounding. Hemahansagaṇi’s laukika analogy of a son killing his father shows how causes and effects can destroy one another in the world, but this does not apply to grammar. Lāvanyasūri disputes this example as socially inappropriate and instead treats the nyāya as rooted in the normative principle that an effect does not harm its cause. Despite differences in interpretation, all traditions agree on the core purpose of this paribhāṣā: it prevents upajīvyavirodha, the paradox of a rule nullifying the very foundation that enables its operation. Yet its occasional suspension through anityatva also reveals that Sanskrit grammar is a flexible system, capable of accommodating exceptions when necessary to preserve overall coherence.",
      "conclusion": "The paribhāṣā sannipāta-lakṣaṇo vidhiḥ animittaṁ tad-vighātasya serves as an essential principle of grammatical coherence, ensuring that an operation arising from a specific conjunction does not destroy that very conjunction. In Haima grammar, it safeguards reduplication in papāca from being nullified by ām-replacement. In Pāṇinian grammar, it clarifies why hrasvatva does not obstruct tuk in grāmaṇi-kulam and why num in śatāni does not trigger luk. Nāgeśa refines its scope and marks it as context-sensitive rather than absolute, while the Mahābhāṣya lists multiple practical uses showing its indispensability. It is therefore a widely recognised yet flexible paribhāṣā, generally applicable but with well-documented exceptions such as atijarasaiḥ. Its persistence across Pāṇinian, Haima, and other grammatical traditions underscores its historical importance as a safeguard against conflicting rule applications in Sanskrit grammar.",
      "Meaning and Application": "This paribhāṣā asserts that a grammatical rule, when it is applied due to the sannipāta or conjunction of two factors, cannot destroy the very cause of its application. The term sannipāta refers to the specific combination or association of two grammatical elements, such as the relationship between a root and a suffix, a base and an augment, or between two rule-driven operations. When such a conjunction becomes the nimitta—the immediate cause or trigger—for the application of another rule, that subsequent rule is called sannipātalakṣaṇa-vidhi. The essence of this nyāya is that the rule, while acting upon the result of the sannipāta, should not nullify the cause that enabled its application. If it destroys its own nimitta, it becomes inapplicable in that situation. A well-known example illustrating this principle is the derivation of papāca. The sūtra dvirdhātuḥ parokṣāṅge prāk tu svaravidheḥ ( H 4.1.1) prescribes reduplication for the root paca, producing papaca. Subsequently, vyañjanasya nāder luk (4.1.44) elides the consonant c, resulting in papā. This reduplication causes the root to acquire anekasvaratva (multiple vowels). Under normal circumstances, the rule dhātor anekasvarād ām parokṣāyāḥ kṛbhvasti cānutadantam (3.4.46) would then apply, replacing ām with ṇav. However, the ṇav itself was the very reason for reduplication. If the replacement now occurs, it would destroy the nimitta which caused reduplication in the first place. To prevent such a contradiction, this paribhāṣā intervenes and suspends the application of 3.4.46 in papāca. Similar situations occur in other derivations. In grāmaṇi-kulam, neuter vowel shortening occurs, but this shortening cannot obstruct the tuk-augmentation prescribed by hrasvasya piti kṛti tuk (P 6.1.71), because the shortening arose from the prātipadika-finality (ajantatva) and cannot nullify its own nimitta. In śatāni, the num-augmentation triggers the ṣaṭ-saṃjñā, which would ordinarily lead to luk, but since the num itself was the cause for the ṣaṭ-saṃjñā, it is not allowed to nullify its own existence. Likewise, in ramāya, the sūtra supi ca (P 7.3.102) prescribes vowel lengthening, yet this lengthening does not obstruct further yad-ādi vowel operations that depend on the ādanta sannipāta. In all these cases, the paribhāṣā works as a safeguard against upajīvyavirodha, a situation where an effect destroys its own cause."

    "text": {
      "source": "The jñāpaka for this paribhāṣā differs across traditions. In the Paninian school, the Mahābhāṣya cites vāha ūṭh (6.4.132) as the explicit jñāpaka. Patanjali discusses how saṃprasāraṇa (vowel alternation) suffices to derive forms like prṣṭhāuh, rendering the ūṭh-operation unnecessary. The very addition of ūṭh in the sūtra becomes an indicator that another underlying principle— bahiraṅga is asiddha in the presence of antaraṅga —is operative. Another Mahābhāṣya discussion on kharavasānayoḥ visarga (8.3.15) also reflects the same precedence: visarga is antaraṅga compared to external repha, hence the repha is asiddha. On acah parasmin (1.1.57), Patanjali explains how antaraṅga tūk-prakriyā must be applied before bahiraṅga lopa or yaṇ substitutions, clearly justifying the same paribhāṣā. Among Vyādi’s two commentaries, one (no. 36) surprisingly states bahiraṅga remains siddha even in the presence of antaraṅga, using omāṅośca (6.1.95) as jñāpaka ; but the other (no. 79) follows the familiar Paninian view— bahiraṅga asiddha antaraṅge —again citing vāha ūṭh. This variation in Vyādi’s text shows historical tension or evolution in interpretation. In the Haima school, Hemacandra’s Nyāyasaṅgraha cites the sūtra na sandhinīy-kvidvidīrghās-dvidhavaskluki H 7.4.111 as the jñāpaka. Here, by denying sthānivadbhāva (substitute behaving like original) in sandhi and dvitva contexts, Hemacandra indirectly asserts that an operation dependent on an external cause like sandhi is bahiraṅga and does not obstruct an internal operation. Nandighoṣavijaya, while commenting on this, explains that the use of “dvi” in this sūtra is an explicit hint toward dvitva and thus serves as the jñāpaka for this paribhāṣā. Thus, both Paninian and Haima systems derive this principle from the purposeful inclusion of “redundant” operations in sūtras, but the textual indicators differ.",
      "historicity": "The precedence of antaraṅga over bahiraṅga is already latent in early derivational logic of the Mahābhāṣya. Patanjali’s discussions on vāha ūṭh and kharavasānayoḥ visarga make it clear that he recognized this principle as a necessary unifying idea: without it, some sūtras would appear superfluous. Vyādi’s two divergent explanations show that the principle was not yet rigidly codified in his time. One reading allows bahiraṅga to remain effective (siddham) even when antaraṅga applies, while the other adopts the asiddha view that later became standard. This implies a transitional stage in vyākaraṇa reasoning. Śīradeva, Pūruṣottama, Haribhāskara, and Durgasiṃha all align with the mature Paninian consensus: antaraṅga overrides bahiraṅga. Yet they disagree on extent. Pūruṣottama and Haribhāskara emphasize its anityatva (non-absoluteness) by citing exceptions like nalopa in vṛtrahabhyām. Durgasiṃha generalizes it into a different hierarchy: alpa-āśraya (fewer conditions) vs bahu-āśraya (many conditions). In the Haima tradition, Hemacandra adopts the principle but with a more restricted scope. Nandighoṣavijaya limits its applicability to jāta-bahiraṅga (where the bahiraṅga has already been performed before antaraṅga arises) and rejects its use for samakālaprāpta-bahiraṅga (where both arise simultaneously). Thus, Haima grammar preserves a narrower version, unlike Nāgeśa’s unification. Nāgeśa, in Paribhāṣenduśekhara, represents the fully developed Paninian view, explicitly covering both jāta and samakālaprāpta bahiraṅga under one paribhāṣā and illustrating both: pacāvedam → jāta-bahiraṅga overridden and vr̥ścati → samakāla-bahiraṅga overridden. Lavanyasūri, while commenting on Hemacandra, sides with Nāgeśa and Patanjali rather than Hemahansagaṇi, showing how later commentators gradually harmonised the Haima system with the Paninian hierarchy.",
      "observation": "From the different commentaries, three major debates emerge: Scope: jāta vs samakālaprāpta. Haima (Nandighoṣavijaya) → accepts only jāta-bahiraṅga invalidity; does not extend to simultaneous competition. Paninian (Nāgeśa) → extends to both, citing vr̥ścati and pacāvedam as proofs. This creates tension: is antaraṅga’s precedence absolute or situational? Nityatva vs Anityatva. Śīradeva and Nāgeśa treat it as nitya (general rule). Pūruṣottama, Haribhāskara, Durgasiṃha admit exceptions, e.g., nalopa in vṛtrahabhyām where bahiraṅga lopa is not blocked. Thus, the principle is generally valid but not universal. Textual indicators (jñāpaka). Paninian → vāha ūṭh, kharavasānayoḥ, acah parasmin are core jñāpakas. Haima → na sandhinīy-kvidvidīrghās-dvidhavaskluki H 7.4.111 with its mention of “dvi” as a hint toward dvitva. Vyādi’s mixed readings show that jñāpaka recognition itself was historically debated. Furthermore, the very definition of antaraṅga and bahiraṅga differs subtly : Durgasiṃha makes it a matter of alpa vs bahu āśraya (few vs many conditions). Mahābhāṣya frames it as kāryakāla priority (earlier vs later operations). Haima uses sandhi vs dvitva vs sthānivadbhāva interplay. Thus, while all agree that some hierarchy between operations exists, the exact mechanics and limits are interpreted differently.",
      "conclusion": "The paribhāṣā asiddhaṃ bahiraṅgam antaraṅge functions as a hierarchical conflict-resolution principle within vyākaraṇa. It asserts that operations dependent on fewer conditions or more internal triggers (antaraṅga) override those with more external or delayed triggers (bahiraṅga), rendering the latter as if undone. In the Paninian school, this principle is fully generalised and justified by multiple Mahābhāṣya discussions, ultimately codified by Nāgeśa to cover both prior and simultaneous bahiraṅga. In the Haima tradition, however, Nandighoṣavijaya keeps it narrowly limited to already-completed bahiraṅga, rejecting simultaneous application. This leads to a subtle doctrinal divide: Paninian commentators aim for unification, whereas Haimas maintain stricter compartmentalisation. Despite such disagreements, all agree that the paribhāṣā is indispensable for preserving the non-redundancy of sūtras and the logical order of derivation. It also underlies practical derivations in both traditions—be it pacāvedam (overriding jāta-bahiraṅga), vr̥ścati (overriding samakālaprāpta), or Hemacandra’s dvitva–sandhi interplay. Its occasional anityatva acknowledged by Pūruṣottama and others shows that while it is a major organizing principle, it cannot supersede every exceptional sūtra-specific constraint. This paribhāṣā exemplifies the interplay between internal economy (antaraṅga priority) and external triggers (bahiraṅga) across grammatical traditions, intra-traditional debates.",
      "Meaning and Application": "The paribhāṣā asiddhaṃ bahiraṅgam antaraṅge establishes the precedence of an antaraṅga operation over a bahiraṅga operation. In this context, an antaraṅga operation is one that is more internal—it depends on fewer conditions, requires a more immediate cause, or operates on the prakṛti (base) itself. A bahiraṅga operation is more external—it requires a broader set of conditions, often arises from affixes or external contexts, and hence is delayed in the derivational sequence. The sense of asiddha here is “treated as if not effected”. Thus, even if a bahiraṅga operation has been performed, when an antaraṅga operation is subsequently required, the prior bahiraṅga operation is regarded as non-existent for the purpose of applying the antaraṅga rule. Conversely, when the antaraṅga operation is being applied, the bahiraṅga cannot obstruct it. For example, in the derivation giryoh, the substitution of ya at the place of i (dependent on the presence of an affix) is a bahiraṅga operation, whereas the lengthening of a vowel prescribed by the Haima sūtra bhvādernāmino dīrghorvorvyañjane H 2.1.63, being dependent directly on the base, is antaraṅga. Here, the bahiraṅga substitution of ya is regarded as asiddha while performing the dīrghavidhi ; hence the dīrgha operation fails because, in the absence of the consonant following r, the necessary condition for the rule is not satisfied. Similarly, in taccāru, the substitution of ca for ta is bahiraṅga since it depends on two words or padas (because of the coming together of two ca), while the substitution of k for c by cajaḥ kagam H 2.1.83 is antaraṅga, dependent on a single pada. Thus, while performing the antaraṅga substitution, the earlier bahiraṅga substitution is treated as asiddha, and the k-substitution does not take place. In the Paninian tradition, this precedence explains cases like pacāvedam, where the guṇa operation on the root is antaraṅga compared to the bahiraṅga āgama operation. Nāgeśa further extends this to samakālaprāpta bahiraṅga, as in vr̥ścati, where samprasāraṇa and v-lopa become simultaneously applicable. Here too the antaraṅga operation overrides the bahiraṅga. Thus, the basic meaning remains: an internal, base-dependent, or minimally conditioned operation has priority, and the external operation is invalidated whenever the internal operation is to be performed."

    "nyaya_name": "Na svarānantarye",
    "text": {
      "source": "In the Haima tradition, Nandighoṣavijaya’s commentary on the Nyāyasaṅgraha explains na svarānantarye as a local exception to the previous paribhāṣā. He states that this rule negates the asiddhatva derived from asiddhaṃ bahiraṅgam antaraṅge but only when vowel adjacency is involved. In iyeṣa and babhūvuṣa, bahiraṅga operations like i → e and kvusu → uṣ must remain effective to create adjacency; only then can antaraṅga iya/uva substitutions operate. He further demonstrates this with vṛttyanto’saṣe: here ru (bahiraṅga, formed by ato’tiroruh) combines with a to produce o via avarṇasya evavarṇādinaidodara, which is antaraṅga. If bahiraṅga ru were nullified, o-formation would fail, but the fact that it proceeds shows this paribhāṣā overrides suppression in adjacency contexts. Nandighoṣavijaya also clarifies why this paribhāṣā cannot merge with antaraṅgaṃ bahiraṅgāt. In na svarānantarye, the bahiraṅga must act first to create adjacency, and only afterward does antaraṅga arise, whereas in antaraṅgaṃ bahiraṅgāt both apply simultaneously and antaraṅga dominates. He further notes that na svarānantarye does not express relative strength (bala) ; it simply denies invalidation of bahiraṅga. Additionally, this paribhāṣā is confined strictly to vowel adjacency ; merging it would wrongly limit antaraṅga principles only to vowels. Hemahaṃsagaṇi explores the example iyeṣa but finds it problematic. He argues that sthanivadbhāva makes e behave like i, thereby blocking iya. Lāvaṇyasūri refutes this, explaining that pūrvasya asve svare itself restricts sthanivadbhāva and does not override adjacency. Hemahaṃsagaṇi then suggests that since najanirdeṣṭa operations are anitya, iya might still apply. Lāvaṇyasūri rejects this, warning that accepting anityatva would lead to incorrect forms like īṣatuḥ. Hemahaṃsagaṇi next proposes the parjanya-vallakṣaṇa-pravṛtti nyāya, which says any asva adjacency forces antaraṅga even after bahiraṅga, but Lāvaṇyasūri counters that sthanivadbhāva merely extends triggers, not final substitution order. In the end, Hemahaṃsagaṇi admits iyeṣa is weak and prefers babhūvuṣa as a better example. In the Pāṇinian tradition, the equivalent paribhāṣā is nājānantarye bahiṣṭyapraklṛptiḥ as seen in the Paribhāṣenduśekhara. Nageśa explains it as a pūrvāpavāda, an exception demonstrating that asiddhaṃ bahiraṅgam is not absolute but contextually anitya. He cites ṣṭvatukor-asiddhaḥ (P.6.1.86) as the jñāpaka: if bahiraṅga suppression persisted even under adjacency, forms like ko’sid or akṣadyuḥ would fail. Vyādi echoes this reasoning: in abhi praiya, tuk (antaraṅga) depends on ekadeśa (bahiraṅga). If ekadeśa were nullified, adjacency would vanish and tuk could never arise; hence bahiraṅga suppression doesn’t apply when adjacency is at stake[cite: 982, 983]. Puruṣottama clarifies that if bahiraṅga suppression continued in adjacency, forms like akṣadyuḥ and ko’sid would be impossible, proving na jānantarye must apply. Śīradeva carefully limits the scope, stating that bahavaḥ and akṣadyuḥ show genuine adjacency with both bahiraṅga and antaraṅga coexisting, but in paca vedam, once ekadeśa is done, adjacency disappears, so antaraṅga cannot arise, and the paribhāṣā doesn’t apply. Haribhāskara agrees: this paribhāṣā applies only when adjacency actively sustains both operations; where adjacency disappears post-bahiraṅga (as in paca vedam), there’s nothing to protect[cite: 986, 987]. He also notes that some Vivaraṇakāras see ṣṭvatukor-asiddhaḥ as implying the anityatva of bahiraṅga-asiddha itself.",
      "historicity": "Historically, this paribhāṣā marks an evolution in refining the antaraṅga-bahiraṅga hierarchy. In early grammatical thought, especially during Vyādi’s period, antaraṅga dominance was rigidly enforced. However, practical derivations like akṣadyuḥ and bahavaḥ showed that overapplying suppression destroyed valid forms. The Haima tradition gives na svarānantarye a systematic placement—Hemacandra explicitly positions it after asiddhaṃ bahiraṅgam, inheriting its terminology but locally negating its effect for vowel adjacency. Hemahaṃsagaṇi and Lāvaṇyasūri’s debates reveal that Haima grammarians treated it as a specific apavāda, not a wholesale revision of hierarchy. In contrast, the Pāṇinian tradition, especially through Nageśa’s Paribhāṣenduśekhara, uses it as a case of showing the anityatva of bahiraṅga suppression. Over time, commentators like Haribhāskara narrowed the scope, emphasising it is not a blanket relaxation but applies only where adjacency sustains both bahiraṅga and antaraṅga.",
      "observation": "From observing both traditions, some themes emerge. First, the Haima school shows deep internal debate. Hemahaṃsagaṇi and Lāvaṇyasūri argue over whether sthanivadbhāva could overrule adjacency, reflecting the Haima system’s holistic, serially linked paribhāṣās that must remain mutually consistent. Second, Pāṇinian commentators uniformly acknowledge this as a pūrvāpavāda, showing that bahiraṅga suppression is contextually limited. Third, the strength of examples differs: Haima commentators ultimately favor babhūvuṣa over iyeṣa due to complications, while Pāṇinian commentators prefer bahavaḥ and akṣadyuḥ. Fourth, scope limitation is critical. Śīradeva and Haribhāskara clarify it applies only when adjacency actively sustains both operations; it does not extend to cases like paca vedam where adjacency disappears post-bahiraṅga. Finally, the two traditions illustrate methodological divergence: Haima treats paribhāṣās as serially connected across chapters, while Pāṇini treats each as relatively independent.",
      "conclusion": "The paribhāṣā, na svarānantarye in the Haima tradition and nājānantarye bahiṣṭyapraklṛptiḥ in the Pāṇinian tradition, is a apavāda that preserves vowel adjacency from being undone by overapplication of the antaraṅga-bahiraṅga hierarchy. In the Haima system, it is integrated into a chain of linked paribhāṣās, balancing internal consistency while resolving derivational paradoxes like iyeṣa. Hemahaṃsagaṇi and Lāvaṇyasūri’s disputes show that its acceptance demanded careful reasoning about sthanivadbhāva and adjacency triggers. In the Pāṇinian tradition, Nageśa, Vyādi, Śīradeva, Puruṣottama, and Haribhāskara uniformly treat it as an exception proving the anityatva of bahiraṅga suppression, but they delimit it only to adjacency contexts where antaraṅga depends on bahiraṅga. Historically, this paribhāṣā reveals the grammarians’ refinement from rigid hierarchy toward contextual hierarchies that preserve valid forms while maintaining systemic consistency.",
      "Meaning and Application": "The paribhāṣā na svarānantarye in the Haima tradition and nājānantarye bahiṣṭyapraklṛptiḥ in the Pāṇinian tradition is an exception (apavāda) to the overarching rule asiddhaṃ bahiraṅgam antaraṅge. Ordinarily, the antaraṅga-bahiraṅga hierarchy dictates that whenever an antaraṅga operation, which is more internal and requires fewer causes, coexists with a bahiraṅga operation, which is more external and requires more causes, the bahiraṅga is treated as asiddha—as if it has not taken effect. But this paribhāṣā restricts the rigid dominance of antaraṅga in one special phonological condition: vowel adjacency (svarānantarya). When two vowels come together, and an antaraṅga operation depends specifically on their adjacency for its trigger, the bahiraṅga operations responsible for creating that adjacency cannot be nullified. Without those bahiraṅga operations, the vowels would never become adjacent, thus making the antaraṅga operation itself impossible. To illustrate, in the derivations iyeṣa and babhūvuṣa, the bahiraṅga operations include the guṇa substitution of iṣ → e and the uṣ-ādeśa from the suffix kvusu. Both are caused by affixal conditions and are therefore bahiraṅga. The antaraṅga operations, on the other hand, are the substitutions iya and uva governed by the rules pūrvasya asve svare yvoriyuv (H.4.1.37) and dhātor ivarṇo varṇasya (H.2.1.50). If the earlier paribhāṣā asiddhaṃ bahiraṅgam were applied mechanically, the bahiraṅga substitutions e and u would be treated as nullified, the vowel adjacency (i + e, u + u) would disappear, and hence the antaraṅga iya/uva would never arise. Thus na svarānantarye ensures vowel adjacency remains intact by not nullifying bahiraṅga in such contexts. A similar situation occurs in vṛttyanto’saṣe (H.1.1.25), where ru is formed bahiraṅgically by ato’tiroruh (H.1.3.20), and then merges with a to give o via avarṇasya evavarṇādinaidodara (H.1.2.6), an antaraṅga process. If the bahiraṅga ru were negated, o-formation would not happen. The fact that o is explicitly accepted proves that na svarānantarye applies to preserve the bahiraṅga change in order to allow the subsequent antaraṅga .Thus the paribhāṣā does not negate the entire antaraṅga principle; it simply tempers its effect in vowel adjacency contexts so as to maintain the sequential integrity of derivation."

    "text": {
      "source": "Within the Haima tradition, the jñāpaka of this paribhāṣā is explicitly seen in the above-cited sūtra caraṇasya sthāṇo’dyatan’yāmanuvāde (H.3.1.138). Though the sūtra itself makes a general statement without specifying mukhya or gauṇa, Hemahaṃsagaṇi in his commentary highlights that the intent must be restricted: only those caraṇa-agents in their primary sense license samāhāra. This inference necessarily arises from the paribhāṣā itself. Nandighoṣavijaya strengthens this reading with carefully selected examples. He explains that in pratyasṭhāt kaṭha-kalāpam and udagāt kaṭha-kauthumam, the compound results in samāhāra-dvandva since kaṭha and kalāpa are truly agents (mukhya-kartṛ). Conversely, in pratyasṭhāt kaṭha-kalāpābhyām, they are merely karaṇa, hence secondary, and no samāhāra is formed. A significant debate arises over bhāva-prayoga (impersonal constructions). Hemahaṃsagaṇi argues that because the suffix in bhāva-prayoga denotes the action (bhāva) rather than the agent, the kartṛ is grammatically demoted to gauṇa, rendering it incapable of triggering operations like samāhāra. He therefore uses bhāva-prayoga as evidence that the paribhāṣā must apply even within kāraka relations. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri rejects this reasoning. He asserts that kartṛ does not lose ontological primacy merely because the suffix denotes bhāva. If this criterion were universally applied, then even in karmāṇi-prayoga (passive voice) the kartṛ would cease to be primary, contradicting the kāraka doctrine which inherently treats the agent as dominant. He further points out that it is logically inconsistent to allow the paribhāṣā to recognize kartṛ once as primary and elsewhere as secondary simply based on the type of suffix; grammatical primacy cannot fluctuate so arbitrarily[cite: 1041, 1042]. Nandighoṣavijaya nevertheless aligns with Hemahaṃsagaṇi. He argues that in Sanskrit grammatical metalanguage, mukhya must be determined morphologically by what the suffix denotes (pratyaya-nirdiṣṭa). Thus, in bhāva and karmāṇi usage, the kartṛ though conceptually a kāraka becomes gauṇa for derivational purposes, because it is not explicitly denoted. Hemahaṃsagaṇi’s claim of anityatva that the paribhāṣā is not universally valid is based on kvip-ending roots like niyau and luvau. These roots could theoretically be gauṇa (due to their suffixal origin), yet substitutions like iya/uva still occur under dhātor ivarṇo varṇasya (H.2.1.50). Vijayalāvaṇyasūri counters that such roots are still mukhya for operational purposes; derivational layering does not demote them to gauṇa[cite: 1047, 1048]. He emphasizes that undermining this lokasiddha nyāya would create unnecessary instability in the rule hierarchy. Thus, in the Haima school the paribhāṣā serves as a decisive interpretive filter, balancing the semantic agency of kārakas with the morphological denotation of suffixes. The Pāṇinian commentators express the same principle, albeit in a narrower operational frame. Nāgeśa in Paribhāṣenduśekhara defines gauṇa as a meaning that arises from an external quality (guṇād āgataḥ), such as go referring to a dull man, and mukhya as the direct lexically established meaning. He explicitly states that grammatical rules attach only to the mukhya meaning. Vyādi, commenting on dyāvāpṛthivī śunāsīra (P.4.2.32), uses agnīṣomau as the jñāpaka: in agnīṣomau māṇavakau where agni is merely a figurative name for a boy, no ṣṭva substitution applies, showing that only the deity (mukhya) meaning triggers the substitution prescribed by agnēr stutstomasomāḥ (P.8.3.82). Śīradeva echoes this in his gloss, citing vīmāṣāñvara-dik striyām (P.5.4.8), where the kh suffix applies only when dik retains its primary directional sense, not when subordinated as in brāhmaṇī. He also clarifies that this paribhāṣā operates only in padakārya (post-word formation operations) and not in prātipadika-kārya (stem-level substitutions), a limitation accepted by all major commentators. Haribhāskara further ties this to the agnīṣomau māṇavakau example, emphasizing that once agni becomes a figurative appellation (gauṇa), its derivative status blocks the ṣṭva operation. Yet in agnīṣomau referring to the actual deities, ṣṭva applies seamlessly .Thus, across both Haima and Pāṇinian traditions, while the specific examples vary, the paribhāṣā’s purpose remains consistent: to ensure that grammatical processes act only on the primary (mukhya) meaning, never on metaphorical (gauṇa) extensions.",
      "historicity": "The semantic hierarchy of mukhya over gauṇa originates in the broader philosophical discourse of Mīmāṃsā, where mukhyārtha is always preferred unless obstructed. Grammar inherits this hierarchy but formalizes it operationally: mukhya sense carries grammatical efficacy, gauṇa does not. In the Haima tradition, Hemacandra integrates this semantic principle into compounding, suffixation, and kāraka interpretation, showing its practical necessity in rule application. The debate between Hemahaṃsagaṇi and Vijayalāvaṇyasūri reflects a transitional phase: how should primacy be defined semantically (via kāraka agency) or morphologically (via suffixal denotation)? In the Pāṇinian tradition, the Bhāṣyakāra acknowledges it as a laukika nyāya, a principle already observable in natural language and anchors it in derivational logic. Later commentators like Nāgeśa refine its domain, confining it to padakārya to maintain systemic stability. Hence, historically, the paribhāṣā exemplifies how ancient grammarians merged philosophical semantics with rigorous morphological ordering, producing a context-sensitive hierarchy rather than a rigid binary.",
      "observation": "In the Haima system, the paribhāṣā is not just semantic but also morphologically contextualized, explaining why in bhāva-prayoga the agent is demoted to gauṇa. This remains contested—Vijayalāvaṇyasūri argues that such demotion undermines kāraka primacy, while Nandighoṣavijaya defends the suffix-centric definition of mukhya. In the Pāṇinian system, the paribhāṣā’s function is more straightforward: it blocks figurative meaning from triggering rules. Thus, agnīṣomau versus agnir māṇavakaḥ is resolved without semantic ambiguity. Its limitation to padakārya prevents unnecessary disruption of prātipadika operations like iya/uva, ensuring layered derivation remains intact. The debates on its supposed anityatva in the Haima tradition illustrate the complexity of integrating derivational history (e.g., kvip-roots) into current operational semantics. However, Vijayalāvaṇyasūri and later commentators reject the anityatva claim, reinforcing its permanence as a lokasiddha nyāya. The paribhāṣā reveals the grammarians deep awareness of how metaphor and literal meaning interact within language, and their effort to constrain metaphor’s grammatical consequences while allowing its communicative richness.",
      "conclusion": "The paribhāṣā gauṇamukhyayor mukhye kāryasampratyayaḥ forms a semantic checkpoint within Sanskrit grammar, ensuring that derivational and morphophonemic rules recognise only primary meaning as grammatically effective. In the Haima tradition, it clarifies why samāhāra-dvandva formation and similar processes fail when the agent becomes instrumental or merely figurative; yet its scope sparked debates over bhāva and karmāṇi usages[cite: 1078, 1079]. Hemahaṃsagaṇi’s morphological view of primacy contrasts with Vijayalāvaṇyasūri’s semantic defence of kāraka hierarchy, showing a live intellectual tension within the tradition. In the Pāṇinian tradition the same principle is present but more narrowly operational, ensuring figurative meaning does not interfere with literal derivations, with clear examples like agnīṣomau versus agnir māṇavakaḥ. Historically, this paribhāṣā reflects the grammarians’ understanding of language’s semantic stratification. It preserves the integrity of grammatical operations by insulating them from metaphorical overreach. It stands as a bridge between semantic theory (mukhyārtha vs. gauṇārtha) and morphological precision, demonstrating how Sanskrit grammar integrates philosophical insight with a technical rule hierarchy.",
      "Meaning and Application": "The twenty-second paribhāṣā gauṇamukhyayor mukhye kāryasampratyayaḥ —“when both secondary (gauṇa) and primary (mukhya) senses of a word are simultaneously possible, grammatical operations should attach only to the primary sense”—functions as a critical semantic safeguard within Sanskrit grammar. Its very purpose is to assert the grammatical priority of mukhya meaning in contexts where gauṇa meaning arises through resemblance, association, or other inferred qualities. The distinction between the two is clear. A mukhya sense (pradhāna) is the direct, conventional (rūḍhi) meaning of a term. For example, go primarily denotes the bovine animal characterized by gotva. Conversely, when the same word refers to a dull man (vāhika), owing to perceived resemblance in unintelligence or sluggishness, the meaning becomes gauṇa, a derivative sense produced through guṇād āgataḥ[cite: 1017, 1018]. Such gauṇa meaning is non-conventional, requiring an overlay of metaphor (upacāra). This paribhāṣā instructs that if both senses are available in a derivational environment, all grammatical processes—compounding (samāsa), suffixation, or phonological substitution—must recognize only the mukhya meaning. A classical example that demonstrates its necessity is agnīṣomau māṇavakau. When agni and soma refer literally to the deities, the ṣṭva substitution is licensed by agnēr stutstomasomāḥ (P.8.3.82). But when agni refers figuratively to a boy named Agni, the sense is merely gauṇa, and no substitution applies. Without this paribhāṣā, the grammar would mistakenly extend derivational effects to metaphorical contexts, thereby overgenerating forms. Similarly, in the Haima grammatical tradition, this paribhāṣā governs the interpretation of the sūtra caraṇasya sthāṇo’dyatan’yāmanuvāde (H.3.1.138). This rule requires that the nominative agent of the roots sthā or iṇ be caraṇa, kaṭha, kalāpa and similar to form a samāhāra-dvandva. The compound pratyasṭhāt kaṭha-kalāpam thus validly yields a neuter singular samāhāra. But when kaṭha or kalāpa appear in the instrumental case (karaṇa relation) as in pratyasṭhāt kaṭha-kalāpābhyām, the agenthood is lost, becoming merely a derivative relation. By the force of this paribhāṣā, only the mukhya-kartṛ triggers the samāhāra-dvandva derivation; the gauṇa sense does not[cite: 1028, 1029]. Thus, the paribhāṣā prevents figurative or instrumentally subordinated words from erroneously acquiring derivational consequences reserved for the true primary referent."

      "source": "Hemahaṃsagaṇi in the Nyāyasaṅgraha formulates the paribhāṣā succinctly and glosses: kārya-saṃpratyaya iti sambandhaḥ. He explains that the kṛtrima sense, although dependent on an upādhi, must be chosen for derivation. He contrasts it with the akṛtrima, which is natural and more intuitive. For example, the paribhāṣā clarifies why in dīrgha-mukhā-śālā the colloquial sense of mukha as the ‘front’ of a hall cannot be taken; only the technical svāṅga counts[cite: 1118, 1119]. Hemahaṃsagaṇi even sees this paribhāṣā as an apavāda to the earlier gauṇamukhyayoḥ mukhye —where, in a clash of primary and secondary meaning, the primary was chosen[cite: 1119, 1120]. Here, though the technical meaning is ‘secondary’ in everyday usage, it prevails because it is essential for śāstric processes. Nandīghoṣavijaya’s Hindi ṭīkā challenges this alignment with Nyāya 22. He argues that the kṛtrima sense is not truly gauṇa in the Pāṇinian sense (derived through resemblance or implication) ; it is simply an artificial stipulation within grammar. Hence it cannot be treated as an apavāda to the primary–secondary hierarchy. He stresses that a paribhāṣā never generates new meaning but clarifies why the sūtra omits explicit details—for example, why Hemacandra separates sva and aṅga in 3.3.86 to avoid unintended application of ātmanepada. Vyādi in his Paribhāṣā-sūcana illustrates the maxim using mahā-rājā-ṭhañ (4.3.97). Here, he notes that suffix ṭhañ is exempted from compounding by na pūjanāt (5.4.69), which itself presupposes that pūjanā refers only to technically defined svat suffixes for ‘honouring’—not to every act of colloquial worship. Thus, the technical meaning (kṛtrima) prevails. Śīradeva in his commentary (§ 101) and Puruṣottamadeva (§ 7) extend the principle beyond svāṅga and gotra to karmapadārtha, karaṇa, and adhikaraṇa. Śīradeva cites karmani dvitīyā (2.3.2): the direct object is the ‘desired-most’ patient of the agent—this is a technical karmasaṃjñā, not any mundane ‘thing affected’. Puruṣottama contrasts kṛtrima and akṛtrima in karmavibhakti, karaṇa, and adhikaraṇa contexts: e.g. saptamy adhikaraṇe ca takes only technical adhikaraṇa, while vipratiṣiddhaṃ cānadhikaraṇavācī is for colloquial loci[cite: 1129, 1130]. Mahābhāṣya further deepens the analysis through the saṅkhyā debate. It concedes that colloquial saṅkhyā is already understood but insists on a technical designation so that suffixes like kaṇ and the behavior of ṣṇ-anta numbers are properly regulated. Without the technical sense, rules about bahu-gaṇa-vatu-ḍati would fail. Patañjali makes it explicit that in grammar “not as in the world” (na yathā loke tathā vyākaraṇe): the śāstric sense is decisive.",
      "historicity": "Historically, this paribhāṣā reveals how grammar evolved from simple descriptive glosses into a self-contained metalanguage. Vyādi’s use is limited: he employs it mainly to shield suffixal prescriptions from vernacular elasticity. Patañjali in the Mahābhāṣya turns it into a philosophical maxim: grammar’s technical categories cannot be dissolved into everyday semantics. Hemahaṃsagaṇi integrates it into his Haimam system but frames it as an apavāda to the prior primary–secondary hierarchy, causing later debates. Vijaya-lāvaṇya refutes that linkage, showing a refined medieval understanding of semantic layers. By the late tradition, Paribhāṣenduśekhara only mentions it in an avataraṇikā, and Nīlakaṇṭha Dīkṣita even hints at its non-absolute (anitya) scope. Yet it remains present in all major collections—Vyādi’s Sūcana, Śākāṭāyana’s Saṅgraha, Puruṣottamadeva’s Laghu-vṛtti. Its endurance shows that the technical–colloquial divide was universally recognised as a source of potential confusion, requiring explicit hierarchy.",
      "observation": "From all traditions certain themes stand out. First, kṛtrima does not mean ‘secondary’ in the semantic-lakṣaṇā sense; it is a grammar-specific category created for derivational precision[cite: 1145, 1146]. Therefore Nandīghoṣavijaya’s insistence that this paribhāṣā is not an apavāda of Nyāya 22 is philologically sound. Second, Mahābhāṣya situates the rule within loka-vyavahāra: people naturally privilege technical names over compositional meaning in everyday commands, so grammar formalises this intuition. Third, the application is not universal; even Patañjali admits that in cases like nadī-paurṇamāsī the technical sense does not override contextual meaning when the sūtra’s intent excludes it. Another significant observation is that the paribhāṣā demonstrates the autonomy of the grammatical system. Śāstric definitions are not mere reflections of colloquial speech but are purpose-built to regulate derivations— kṛtrima designations like svāṅga, gotra, saṅkhyā are privileged precisely because they enable systematic rule-behavior. This aligns with the Mahābhāṣya’s dictum na yathā loke tathā vyākaraṇe.",
      "conclusion": "Paribhāṣā 23—kṛtrimākṛtrimayoḥ kṛtrime kārya-saṃpratyayaḥ—secures the precedence of technical definitions over natural language meanings in grammatical operations. In examples ranging from svāṅga-compounds to gotra-suffixes and saṅkhyā-classifications, it ensures that the artificial, upādhi-based category governs derivation. Vyādi invokes it to limit suffixal exceptions; Patañjali uses it to explain why even familiar words like one, two, three need a special saṃjñā; Hemahaṃsagaṇi makes it an apavāda to Nyāya 22, though Vijaya-lāvaṇya clarifies that its semantic axis is different[cite: 1155, 1156]. Historically, this paribhāṣā testifies to the grammar’s conscious detachment from vernacular ambiguity. It legitimises the technical lexicon as a higher-order domain, enabling precise rule-application without being undermined by everyday language. It remains a cornerstone of vyākaraṇa hermeneutics: a maxim that guarantees the integrity of the system whenever technical and natural senses collide.",
      "Meaning and Application": "(When both a “constructed” technical sense kṛtrima and a “natural” akṛtrima sense are possible, grammatical operation must be based on the kṛtrima sense.) [cite: 1086, 1087] This paribhāṣā sets forth a vital interpretive hierarchy within Sanskrit grammar: whenever a word carries both a colloquial, intuitive meaning (akṛtrima) and a technical, grammar-induced meaning (kṛtrima), grammatical operations must be performed only on the kṛtrima sense. The relationship between these two senses is clarified by the commentators. The kṛtrima is ‘constructed’, arising solely because the śāstric metalanguage defines an upādhi, a qualifying restriction. It is secondary in the epistemic sense because it depends on an artificial stipulation. The akṛtrima is the natural, vernacular meaning which exists independent of any grammatical stipulation. The paribhāṣā declares that, in the contest between these two, the kṛtrima dominates for the purposes of grammatical derivation. The canonical example comes from the rule “asahanaj-vidyamāna-pūrvapadāt svāṅgād akroḍādibhyaḥ” (H 2.4.38). Here the suffix ṅī would apply when a svāṅga—a bodily limb—is compounded with a word like śālā. In ordinary language, mukha (face) is indeed the ‘front’ or ‘mouth’ of a hall. But under the technical definition, svāṅga must be “avikāro’dravyaṃ mūrtaṃ prāṇisthaṃ svāṅgam ucyate”—an unmodified, solid part of a living being or its replica in an image. A hall is not a living organism, so its mukha is not svāṅga in the technical sense. Thus the colloquial sense is overridden, and ṅī is not allowed. Another illustration appears in the construction of gotra terms. In Pāṇini’s kṛṇvādi-bhyo gotre iñaś ca (4.2.111–112), the suffix iñ applies to names like Dākṣa to yield Dākṣārmi, a descendant of Dakṣa. But if one were to take pāṇini merely as a ‘descendant of Pāṇin’ in the colloquial sense, it would not yield pāṇinīya ; instead, the technical gotra meaning specifically defined for grammatical derivation must be chosen, and the suffix śa is applied after lopa of iñ. Śīradeva explicitly argues that rājanya in the gotra context is taken only technically, not colloquially, to prevent unwanted derivations. The Mahābhāṣya reinforces this logic through the treatment of saṅkhyā. In 1.1.23, Patañjali asks why “one, two, three” should receive a technical designation as saṅkhyā when they are already known as numbers in common speech. He answers that without the technical designation, they would remain akṛtrima and therefore could not trigger suffixal rules that rely on the saṅkhyā-saṃjñā. This is precisely why the paribhāṣā is needed: it ensures the grammar’s special sense controls derivation rather than the layman’s meaning. The Mahābhāṣya gives a vivid everyday parallel: “Bring Go-pālaka, bring Kaṭajaka.” In actual speech, the hearer brings the man bearing the artificial name Go-pālaka or Kaṭajaka—he does not fetch a literal cowherd or a person born on a log. The constructed sense (name as a technical label) dominates the compositional meaning. Thus even in loka-vyavahāra the kṛtrima sense can outweigh the compositional one, so in grammar it must prevail for rule application."

      "source": "This paribhāṣā is an explicit exception (apavāda) to the prior nyāya kṛtrimākṛtrimayoḥ kṛtrime kārya-saṃpratyayaḥ. He explains that gati here means acceptance or grahaṇa, and kvacit or kadācit indicates occasional applicability. Hemahaṃsagaṇi illustrates it through the sutra nāḍītantrībhyaṃ svāṅge (H 7.3.180), where the kṛtrima svāṅga definition applies in bahunāḍiḥ kāyaḥ or bahutantrī greevā. The nāḍī and tantrī here are not prāṇistha (not located in animate beings) and thus fail the grammatical definition of svāṅga. Yet, in popular speech, one finds expressions like bahunāḍiḥ stambhaḥ and bahutantrī vīṇā, where nāḍī and tantrī are understood as natural (akṛtrima) parts. A doubt arises: why are nāḍī and tantrī treated as non-prāṇistha when stambha (pillar) comes from dāru (wood), which in turn is from a tree, an ekendriya-prāṇi? Hemahaṃsagaṇi resolves this by referring to prāṇyauṣadhi-vṛkṣebhyo’vayave ca (6.2.31). If prāṇi meant all animate beings, including trees, then the terms vṛkṣa and auṣadhi would not have been separately mentioned in the sutra. This indicates that in grammatical contexts, prāṇi refers exclusively to trasa (sentient beings) and excludes sthāvara (immobile beings like trees). Therefore, nāḍī from a tree is not counted as prāṇistha and hence fails as a kṛtrima svāṅga. Nandighoṣavijaya in his commentary concludes that even though the previous nyāya would only allow kṛtrima meanings, here we see actual usage (prayoga) validating both kṛtrima and akṛtrima. Thus, this paribhāṣā exists to account for such dual acceptance. He emphasizes that this nyāya, like its predecessor, is not universal but occasional. For instance, in śiro’dhasaḥ pade samāsaikye (2.3.4), only the akṛtrima sense of pada is taken, despite the possibility of kṛtrima as defined by tadantaṃ padam (1.1.20). Vijayalāvanya Sūri adds that where the prakaraṇa (context) itself clarifies whether kṛtrima or akṛtrima is intended, there is no ambiguity. However, where the context is neutral and both are viable, kvacid ubhayagatiḥ applies. Vyādi presents this principle with slightly altered wording as kṛtrimākṛtrimayor ubhayagatiḥ bhavati. His examples clarify its operational balance. For karaṇa: in sādhakatamaṃ karaṇam (1.4.42), the kṛtrima meaning of karaṇa (the most effective instrument) is taken. But in śabda-vaira-kalaha-abhrakaṇvamedhebhyaḥ karaṇe (3.1.17), the akṛtrima (natural) sense of karaṇa is required. Similarly, for adhikaraṇa: in ādhāro’dhikaraṇam (1.4.45), the kṛtrima (technical) sense of locus is intended, while in vipratiṣiddhaṃ cānadhikaraṇavāci (2.4.13) and ic-karmavyatihāre (5.4.127), only the akṛtrima meaning is operative. Furthermore, Vyādi adds an important dimension for numbers: saṅkhyākāryeṣu cākṛtrimāpi saṅkhyā bhavati. In number-related operations, even the akṛtrima (natural, popular) numerals are considered valid alongside the technical definitions. This reading from Vyādi confirms that ubhayagati is not a contradictory stance but a pragmatic acceptance of co-existing layers of meaning, where the system alternates between technical and natural senses depending on the grammatical domain.",
      "historicity": "Historically, this paribhāṣā reflects a maturing stage in grammatical hermeneutics. Initially, there was a rigid dichotomy: earlier paribhāṣās, such as kṛtrimākṛtrimayoḥ kṛtrime kāryasaṃpratyayaḥ, elevated the kṛtrima over the akṛtrima by treating the technical, paribhāṣā-defined meaning as supreme. However, as practical derivations and observed linguistic usage (prayoga-darśana) posed challenges, grammarians acknowledged the need for flexibility. The debates around nāḍītantrī demonstrate how rigid insistence on kṛtrima svāṅga would contradict widely-accepted locutions like bahunāḍiḥ stambhaḥ. Similarly, in Mahābhāṣya (1.1.23 bahu-gaṇa-vatu-ḍati-saṅkhyā), Patañjali himself points to cases like go-pālaka mānaya, kaṭajaka mānaya, where only the kṛtrima sense applies, but in nadī-paurṇamāsyāgrahāṇībhyām, even the akṛtrima sense must be acknowledged. This fluidity shows that the principle of strict technicality was softened in later grammatical discourse. The Haima tradition explicitly frames kvacid ubhayagatiḥ as an apavāda to the preceding rule, maintaining an internal hierarchy while admitting occasional departures. In contrast, Vyādi and the Pāṇinian school present it as a pragmatic recognition of linguistic diversity, especially in karaṇa, adhikaraṇa, and saṅkhyā contexts. Thus, the historical evolution of this paribhāṣā reveals a shift from absolutist interpretations toward a more descriptive, usage-sensitive approach in Sanskrit grammar.",
      "observation": "Hemahaṃsagaṇi and Nandighoṣavijaya underline that prayoga-darśana (actual observed usage) is the key evidence for this paribhāṣā. They admit that while kṛtrima definitions hold precedence, there are situations like nāḍītantrī and svāṅga where popular usage cannot be ignored. Vyādi highlights that some domains demand only kṛtrima (e.g., sādhakatamaṃ karaṇam), some demand only akṛtrima (e.g., vipratiṣiddhaṃ cānadhikaraṇavāci), while others allow both (e.g., saṅkhyākārya). Thus, ubhayagati serves as a bridge to resolve apparent contradictions. Prakaraṇa-dependence: Vijayalāvanya Sūri stresses that this rule does not introduce chaos. Where prakaraṇa clearly dictates a choice, ubhayagati does not apply. It is relevant only when the context is neutral or ambiguous .Occasional nature: Both Haima and Pāṇinian traditions agree that this is not a universal doctrine but applies selectively, making it inherently kadācit (occasional).",
      "conclusion": "The paribhāṣā kvacid ubhayagatiḥ functions as a apavāda of kṛtrimākṛtrimayoḥ kṛtrime kāryasaṃpratyayaḥ. It acknowledges that in certain contexts, both kṛtrima (paribhāṣā-derived) and akṛtrima (natural, popular) meanings can coexist and be valid for grammatical operations. In the Haima tradition, it is exemplified by nāḍītantrī cases, where paribhāṣika svāṅga definitions are relaxed in favour of popular usage. In the Pāṇinian tradition, Vyādi systematically demonstrates how karaṇa, adhikaraṇa, and saṅkhyā domains alternate between technical and natural senses depending on context. Historically, this paribhāṣā reflects the grammarians’ effort to balance śāstra-prasiddhi (grammatical system) with loka-prasiddhi (popular usage), allowing occasional flexibility to preserve meaningful derivations. Its scope remains kadācit, guided by context (prakaraṇa) and confirmed by prayoga-darśana. In essence, kvacid ubhayagatiḥ represents an important adjustment within Sanskrit grammar, enabling it to remain both systematically coherent and usage-sensitive.",
      "Meaning and Application": "The paribhāṣā kvacid ubhayagatiḥ establishes that in some instances, both the kṛtrima (artificial, paribhāṣā-defined) and akṛtrima (natural, popularly understood) senses of a word or grammatical entity may simultaneously be taken for grammatical operations. Here, gati means grahaṇa (acceptance or inclusion), and kvacit indicates that this is not a universal principle but applies only in certain contexts where both meanings coexist and are equally justifiable. It stands as an apavāda (exception) to the preceding nyāya kṛtrimākṛtrimayoḥ kṛtrime kāryasaṃpratyayaḥ, which asserts that whenever both artificial and natural senses are possible, only the kṛtrima should be considered for grammatical rules. In contrast, kvacid ubhayagatiḥ allows a middle ground where both are acceptable in practice and acknowledges situations where usage (prayoga-darśana) confirms the coexistence of both senses. For example, Hemahaṃsagaṇi in the Nyāyasaṃgraha explains that in the sutra nāḍītantrībhyaṃ svāṅge (7.3.180), the kṛtrima svāṅga sense of nāḍī and tantrī defined in grammar as avikāraḥ dravaṃ mūrtaṃ prāṇisthaṃ svāṅgam excludes inanimate objects such as stems or musical instruments. Therefore, in bahunāḍiḥ kāyaḥ or bahutantrī greevā, the kac suffix is prohibited. However, the same words in a purely akṛtrima (natural) sense, such as bahunāḍiḥ stambhaḥ or bahutantrī vīṇā, remain valid in usage. This co-existence of two senses is accepted in practice and thereby leads to the understanding that both senses (ubhayagatiḥ) are sometimes permissible. Similarly, Vyādi clarifies that in some cases grammatical rules explicitly rely on the kṛtrima meaning (e.g., sādhakatamaṃ karaṇam, 1.4.42), while in other rules, the akṛtrima meaning applies (e.g., śabda-vaira-kalaha-abhrakaṇvamedhebhyaḥ karaṇe, 3.1.17). However, in other domains such as saṅkhyākārya (operations involving numbers), both natural and paribhāṣika meanings of numbers are accepted. This demonstrates a fluidity, where grammatical tradition recognizes the possibility of dual acceptance rather than rigid exclusion. Thus, the application of kvacid ubhayagatiḥ is context-dependent. It is neither a blanket rule favoring kṛtrima nor an unconditional acceptance of akṛtrima meanings. Instead, it is a reconciliatory principle that acknowledges certain gray areas where tradition allows both meanings to stand valid simultaneously."

It says that if this paribhāṣā did not exist, the sūtra inhan-pūṣāryamṇaḥ śiṣyor dīrghaḥ would not have been composed because the same result (vowel-lengthening) is already derivable from the earlier ni dīrghaḥ. The new sūtra therefore indicates that there is a restriction: ina-ādīnām śiṣyor eva dīrghaḥ, nānyaghūṭi —for the roots in, han, pūṣ, and aryaman, lengthening occurs only before śi and si, not before any ghuṭ-affix.

The Nyāyasaṅgraha further clarifies that the jñāpaka is the very act of introducing a new sūtra where the operation would otherwise already be covered. If there were no intent of restriction, the new sūtra would not be needed. Thus, the additional sūtra signals a niyama rather than a redundant reiteration.",
      "historicity": "The notion of siddhe satyārambhaḥ as a paribhāṣā emerges from the intersection of Pāṇinian grammar with Mīmāṃsā interpretive techniques. In the Mīmāṃsā school, niyama is carefully distinguished from parisaṅkhyā, and the rules governing their application are systematically elaborated. However, in Vyākaraṇa the distinction is adopted in a modified form, more suited to linguistic operations rather than ritual injunctions. The Mahābhāṣya mentions niyama in various contexts, but it does not formulate it as a standalone paribhāṣā. Instead, it uses examples like the bahu-gaṇa-vatu-ḍati-saṅkhyā discussion (P 1.1.23) to show how new rules clarify or restrict general usages already known in loka. Over time, in the post-Pāṇinian grammatical tradition, especially in works like Kātantra Paribhāṣā and Nyāyasaṅgraha, this principle was codified explicitly as a paribhāṣā. Hemahaṃsagaṇi acknowledges its anityatva. This is consistent with the history of paribhāṣās themselves: they were extracted inductively from observed Pāṇinian practices and later generalized as meta-rules. Nandighoṣavijaya notes that this paribhāṣā is not universally accepted across all grammatical traditions. In the Kāśikā and Siddhānta Kaumudī traditions, the idea is implicitly recognised but not treated as a formal paribhāṣā. In contrast, in Jain and Haima grammatical traditions, it is explicitly formulated. Vijayalāvanyasūri highlights the historical interplay between the grammatical and Mīmāṃsā perspectives. While Mīmāṃsā treats niyama as a philosophically distinct category (restriction arising from multiple possibilities), Vyākaraṇa simplifies it to a practical interpretive tool for avoiding overextension of a sūtra. This adaptation shows how grammar selectively borrowed and reinterpreted Mīmāṃsā categories in its own technical context. It is also historically significant that this paribhāṣā was explicitly treated as an anitya rule by later commentators. For instance, the lihādi-prapañca in the fifth adhyāya of Aṣṭādhyāyī shows that not all new sūtras are niyama-oriented. Here, the new sūtras serve prapañcārtha—elaborating or clarifying subclasses within an existing set. This discussion indicates that over centuries, grammarians observed patterns in sūtra composition and gradually categorized them into niyama, parisaṅkhyā, or prapañca. Thus, historically, siddhe satyārambho niyamārthaḥ is a meta-observation distilled by later scholastic traditions to explain Pāṇini’s sometimes layered rule architecture. It was likely developed more fully in the post-Mahābhāṣya period when the need arose to systematically justify every additional sūtra and its purpose within the concise structure of grammatical sūtras.",
      "observation": "Nandighoṣavijaya, in his Hindi commentary, elaborates on this principle by demonstrating both its validity and its limitations. He notes that in daṇḍi and similar examples, the general rule ni dīrghaḥ allows lengthening, but the new sūtra inhan-pūṣa restricts this to specific cases. Thus, the purpose of the new sūtra is indeed niyama. He clarifies that the re-initiation of a new sūtra itself is the jñāpaka. If this paribhāṣā did not exist, the new sūtra would simply be unnecessary. However, he also introduces the issue of anityatva (non-universality). Not all new sūtras introduced over an already derivable operation are intended as restrictive. For example, in the lihādi-prapañca case, the sūtra lihādibhyaḥ (H 5.1.50) already prescribes the ac suffix for the lihādi class, and thus by this, arhādi roots in the same environment would also receive ac. Yet, another group of six sūtras beginning with arho’c (H 5.1.91) is introduced. These later sūtras do not serve a restrictive niyama but rather a classificatory and elaborative function (prapañcārtha), distinguishing arhādi roots from the lihādi class for the sake of clarity. Thus, this paribhāṣā cannot be universally applied, sometimes new sūtras serve merely to differentiate and elaborate rather than to restrict. This distinction is crucial: not every later sūtra following an earlier general rule is a niyama-sūtra. Some are prapañcārtha, introduced for the sake of textual clarity, systematic separation of classes, or pedagogical elaboration. Hence, the paribhāṣā is context-dependent and cannot be used mechanically. Vijayalāvanyasūri provides a nuanced interpretation that bridges Vyākaraṇa and Mīmāṃsā. He notes that in Mīmāṃsā, niyama is defined as restricting multiple equally possible methods, while in Vyākaraṇa it functions as limiting a general rule. For instance, in the Mīmāṃsā example of rice pounding for sacrificial purposes (vrīhīnām avaghātaḥ), the act of pounding is not absolutely necessary because dehusking can be achieved by other means like nailing or rubbing; hence the pounding is only a pākṣikī prāpti (contingent means). In contrast, in Vyākaraṇa the niyama simply narrows a general prescription. Vijayalāvanya also quotes Nāgeśa Bhaṭṭa, who clarifies the difference between niyama and parisaṅkhyā: niyama deals with a case where an operation would over-extend and needs to be restricted, whereas parisaṅkhyā is an outright exclusion from applicability. He points out that in Vyākaraṇa, the term niyama is used more loosely than in Mīmāṃsā, often corresponding to restriction or clarification rather than a strict exclusive imposition. In Nyāyārthasindhu, Vijayalāvanya again emphasizes that in some cases the later sūtra indeed restricts the general rule, as in inhan-pūṣa restricting ni dīrghaḥ. But in other cases, such as arho’c and its related sūtras, the later sūtras are composed not for restriction but for prapañcārtha, i.e., elaborating and differentiating specific subgroups within a larger class. Thus, the paribhāṣā has anityatva; it explains many cases but not all. Furthermore, he clarifies the interpretive method: when a later sūtra appears, one must first examine whether it genuinely restricts the earlier rule (niyama), or whether it is only introduced for elaboration (prapañcārtha). The act of composing a new sūtra alone cannot be simplistically assumed to always indicate restriction; the context must determine its role. The Mahābhāṣya also supports this nuanced reading. In discussing bahu-gaṇa-vatu-ḍati saṅkhyā (P 1.1.23), it acknowledges that numbers like eka, dvi are already understood in loka (common usage), yet a sūtra is still introduced to clarify their technical scope within grammar. Here the new sūtra is not a restriction but a technical clarification. Thus, grammar sometimes uses siddhe satyārambhaḥ to restrict, and sometimes to define or clarify.",
      "conclusion": "From all these verifiable sources—Nyāyasaṅgraha, Nandighoṣavijaya’s commentary, and Vijayalāvanyasūri’s discussions in Nyāyārthasindhu—it is evident that siddhe satyārambho niyamārthaḥ primarily functions to defend the economy of the sūtras by ensuring that every later rule has a meaningful purpose. When a result is already derivable, a new sūtra is composed either to narrow the applicability of the earlier rule (true niyama) or, in some contexts, to elaborate, differentiate, or clarify (prapañcārtha). Thus, the principle guards against accusations of redundancy but must be applied with contextual discernment. While in cases like daṇḍi the paribhāṣā clearly demonstrates a restrictive function, in other cases like the lihādi-prapañca, the new sūtras serve classification rather than restriction. Vijayalāvanya shows that the paribhāṣā aligns with the broader philosophical idea of purposeful composition but cannot be universally applied without exception. Therefore, siddhe satyārambho niyamārthaḥ is a vital but context-sensitive interpretive tool in the grammatical tradition. It ensures that the architecture of sūtras remains precise, meaningful, and non-redundant, while its historical evolution reflects the interaction between Pāṇinian practices and the broader theories of Mīmāṃsā.",
      "Meaning and Application": "This paribhāṣā functions as an interpretive safeguard within Vyākaraṇa to explain why new sūtras are sometimes introduced despite the fact that the grammatical operation in question appears to have already been accomplished by an earlier sūtra. It states that when a grammatical result is already derivable (siddha) by an existing rule, and yet the śāstrakṛt (author of the grammatical system) deliberately composes another sūtra, this new sūtra must have a niyama-purpose, meaning it restricts or qualifies the scope of the earlier more general prescription. In simpler terms, it removes the suspicion of nairarthakya (futility or redundancy) by asserting that a fresh sūtra is not composed without reason; it must aim at restricting or clarifying an earlier generalization ,. The practical function of niyama in Vyākaraṇa is narrower than in Mīmāṃsā. In the Mīmāṃsā tradition, niyama typically occurs when multiple equally valid methods exist, and the rule directs that only one method should be followed. In Vyākaraṇa, however, niyama is more about limiting an over-general application of a rule that would otherwise apply beyond the intended context. Thus, the paribhāṣā explains that the second sūtra is neither redundant nor simply a reiteration, but it restricts the generality of the earlier rule. The classic example offered in Nyāyasaṅgraha is the derivation of forms like daṇḍin. By the general rule ni dīrghaḥ (H 1.4.85), lengthening of the penultimate vowel is prescribed before ghuṭ-affixes. Therefore, by this rule alone, one might expect lengthening in daṇḍinā and similar forms. However, a new sūtra inhan-pūṣāryamṇaḥ śiṣyor dīrghaḥ (H 1.4.87) is deliberately introduced. This additional sūtra restricts the general operation by specifying that such vowel-lengthening applies only when śi or si follows the roots in, han, pūṣ, and aryaman, and not for all ghuṭ-affixes. Thus, although the earlier rule could have covered this case, the later sūtra introduces a restriction, ensuring that in daṇḍinā no lengthening occurs. The very fact of the later sūtra’s composition becomes a jñāpaka (indicator) that it serves a restrictive purpose. Therefore, this paribhāṣā helps establish interpretive discipline: when a new sūtra appears, it should not be dismissed as redundant but understood as a deliberate effort to narrow, qualify, or refine the earlier general prescription."

    "text": {
      "source": "The jñāpaka for this paribhāṣā is derived from the very absence of explicit qualifiers in rules such as “ūd duṣo ṇau” (4.2.40) and “aḥ sṛji-dṛśoḥ akiti” (4.4.111). These rules mention the root in its bare form without adding adjectives like “when used as a nominal” or “even after kvip ”. Despite this, we observe in the śāstric tradition that when kvip converts the root into a nominal stem, the operations cease to apply. Hemahansagaṇi points out that in examples like dūṣayati and sraṣṭā/draṣṭā, the vowel change or augment appears because the suffixes ṇic or akit are directly attached to the roots. But in cases like rajju-sṛgbhyām or doṣayati (where kvip has intervened), these changes are absent. Thus, the non-occurrence of lengthening or augment after kvip despite the rule’s literal mention of the root indicates that the tradition presupposes a qualifying principle: dhātoḥ kāryam ucyamānaṁ tat-pratyaye bhavati -When an operation is enjoined for a root, it applies only when the intended suffix is directly attached to that root. The Mahābhāṣya on mṛjer vṛddhiḥ makes this explicit. Patañjali says: “mṛjer vṛddhi-vidhau kvip-pratiṣedhaḥ” – in the context of vṛddhi for mṛj, a prohibition must be stated for kvip forms. “athavā dhātoḥ svarūpa-grahaṇe tat-pratyaye kārya-vijñānāt siddham” – alternatively, from the mere mention of the root’s form, it is understood that the operation applies only when that very suffix is attached. Thus the Mahābhāṣya treats this as a siddha-paribhāṣā, derived from jñāpaka and teacher’s intent (ācārya-pravṛtti).",
      "historicity": "This paribhāṣā has its roots in the Mahābhāṣya. Patañjali discusses it under the rule mṛjer vṛddhiḥ, showing its practical origin in controlling overapplication of vṛddhi to kvip derived stems. The Mahābhāṣya’s reasoning— “svarūpa-grahaṇe tat-pratyaye kārya-vijñānāt siddham” became the foundational statement for later traditions. In the Pūruṣottama laghuparibhāṣāvṛtti Pāṇinian school, it appears as “dhātoḥ svarūpa-grahaṇe tat-pratyaye eva kāryasaṃvijñānam”, emphasising the restriction to pratyaya-conditioned operations. Hemahansagaṇi integrates this principle in the Nyāyasaṃgraha with slight adaptation, as his system sometimes differs in processual detail (like the treatment of sthānivadbhāva). Hemahansagaṇi faithfully restates the principle but contextualises it with examples, showing how even after kvip derivation, the nominal status blocks root operations. The Nyāyasamuccaya Taranga commentary of Vijayalāvanyasūri gives a refined philosophical interpretation, discussing its domain of validity (pratyaya-nimitta only) and its limitations (it does not affect pādāntatva-nimitta operations). He also traces the interplay of sthānivadbhāva, showing how the paribhāṣā complements rather than contradicts other metarules. Unlike some universally accepted paribhāṣās (like sāvadhāraṇa-vākya), this one was not recorded in Vyādi’s Paribhāṣā-sūcana or Śākaṭāyana’s collection, indicating it is an interpretive principle developed primarily in the Pāṇinian-Mahābhāṣya line and adopted by the Haimā school due to shared practical necessity.",
      "observation": "The Nyāyasaṃgraha of Hemahansagaṇi is clear that this paribhāṣā serves as a restrictive rule. It is not universally applicable to all operations involving the root’s phonological shape but only when the operation is explicitly conditioned on a suffix. It does not affect operations triggered by other factors like pādāntatva (word-final position). Nandighoṣavijaya elaborates this distinction. He emphasizes that kvip-derived stems retain both dhātutva (verbality) and nāmatva (nominality) simultaneously (dhātu-nāma-ubhayasadbhāva), but for practical purposes, when a subsequent suffix is added to such a nominal, it is treated as attached to a nāma, not a dhātu. Therefore, operations like ū-lengthening (ūd duṣo ṇau) or a-augment (aḥ sṛji-dṛśoḥ akiti) do not trigger in the nominal environment. Taranga commentary of Vijayalāvanyasūri further clarifies its practical reach. He notes that this paribhāṣā is operative only in pratyaya-nimitta-kārya (operations conditioned specifically by suffix attachment) but not in operations triggered by other contexts like pādāntatva. For example, in pra-nadbhyām, the substitution of g for ś under “naśo vā” (H 2.1.70) is based on word-final conditions rather than suffixal adjacency, so the paribhāṣā does not interfere. Similarly, it is not invoked for rules like dhātor ivaṇo varṇasya eyuvaḥ svare pratyaye (2.1.50), where only the dhātutva itself is the condition, not the suffix. From the Pāṇinian tradition, Pūruṣottama explains in his vṛtti that this paribhāṣā protects against unwarranted application of operations like vṛddhi (mṛjer vṛddhiḥ), nummāgama, ṭi-lopa, etc., to nominal stems. He shows how in bhrūṇa-hatyā (derived from hanti via kvip), if the original root-based operations continued even after kvip, we would wrongly predict ṭi-lopa or kutu substitution. The fact that Pāṇini introduces t-insertion by nīpātana (special stipulation) in bhrūṇa-hatyā indicates that the default root-based operation is blocked after kvip, thus necessitating the paribhāṣā. The Mahābhāṣya also emphasizes that teacher’s intention (ācārya-pravṛtti) itself functions as the ultimate authority. Even if the paribhāṣā is not separately codified as an explicit sūtra, the teacher’s examples (bhrūṇa-hatyā, doṣayati, rajju-sṛgbhiḥ) show that the restriction is operative. An important observation is the debate about sthānivadbhāva (substitute retains original properties). Some commentators wondered if kvip’s disappearance (through lopa or luk) should count as a sthānivadbhāva event, thereby allowing the nominal to still act like the original dhātu. Vijayalāvanyasūri resolves this through Mahābhāṣya: kvip’s lopa is not a true luk/lub substitute but an aprayogīt (non-use), so it does not retain dhātu-level adjacency. Hence, the suffix following a kvip-derived nominal does not meet the condition for root operations. This shows the paribhāṣā’s functional necessity to prevent inappropriate sthānivad-bhāva extension.",
      "conclusion": "This paribhāṣā, dhātoḥ svarūpa-grahaṇe tat-pratyaye kārya-vijñānam, serves as an essential interpretive safeguard. It clarifies the domain of operations mentioned on a root, restricting them to cases where the specified suffix is directly attached. It prevents over-extension of root-based phonological and morphological operations into nominal environments created by kvip and similar intermediaries. The jñāpaka lies in the selective application of rules like ūd duṣo ṇau and aḥ sṛji-dṛśoḥ akiti—they apply in direct dhātu contexts but not after kvip-derived nominals. Mahābhāṣya explicitly highlights this in the mṛjer vṛddhiḥ discussion and uses bhrūṇa-hatyā as confirmatory evidence. Although Patañjali says that it need not be separately codified as a distinct paribhāṣā, because Pāṇini intention already conveys this principle implicitly. Later commentators in both the Haimā and Pāṇinian traditions use this paribhāṣā as necessary for maintaining internal consistency of derivational processes. Thus, while not universal in scope like some other nyāyas, it remains indispensable for controlling the interface between root-based operations and nominal derivations.",
      "Meaning and Application": "This paribhāṣā states that when a grammatical rule mentions the bare form (svarūpa) of a root, the intended operation is understood to apply only when the specific suffix (pratyaya) mentioned in the rule is directly attached to that root. If the suffix occurs indirectly, mediated by another suffix (such as kvip, which converts a root into a nominal stem), the operation will not apply. The core idea is one of restriction by adjacency: the relationship between the root and the suffix must be immediate for the operation to take place. Hemahansagaṇi in the Nyāyasaṃgraha explains this through the principle of sāvadhāraṇa, that the grammatical statement is always to be interpreted with qualification unless explicitly extended. Thus, if a rule says “in the root dṛś, when followed by a certain suffix, an operation occurs,” it cannot be generalised beyond that very root-suffix relationship to nominal derivatives or further-compounded forms. For example, in the case of the root duṣ in the formation duṣyati. When the suffix ṇic is applied directly to duṣ, we get dūṣayati due to the rule “ūd duṣo ṇau” (H 4.2.40), which prescribes the lengthening of the vowel u to ū before ṇic. However, when duṣ first takes the suffix kvip, it becomes a nominal stem (doṣa). If this nominal then takes ṇic, though structurally the suffix ṇic follows the same segment duṣ, it is no longer the same grammatical relationship: the root has been mediated by kvip. In such a mediated nominal state, the original operation of vowel lengthening cannot apply. This shows the necessity of this paribhāṣā to prevent unintended overextension of root-based operations to nominal or derivative environments. Similarly, in rajju-sṛgbhyām the rule “aḥ sṛji-dṛśoḥ akiti” (4.4.111), which prescribes the augment a for the roots sṛj/dṛś before akit-pratyayas, applies only in cases like sraṣṭā, draṣṭā. It does not apply to rajju-sṛgbhyām, because here the suffixal environment relates to a nominal derivative, not to the root itself. The same reasoning holds for roots like masj (masji → udaka-magbhyām), naś (pra-nadbhyām), and hanti (bhrūṇa-ghnaḥ). Thus, the paribhāṣā safeguards the domain of root operations (dhātu-kārya) and restricts them from spilling over into nominal (nāma) domains unless explicitly specified."

    "text": {
      "source": "The source of this paribhāṣā given by Hemahaṅsagaṇi is the sūtra “yyakye” (H 1.2.25). There, kya is negated, but the negation is understood to extend automatically to structurally similar suffixes like kyan, kyang, and kyanṣ without being explicitly listed. The fact that the sūtra does not spell out all such similar suffixes becomes the jñāpaka (indicator) of this paribhāṣā. In Hemahansagaṇi’s words, vibhāsakaṁ prāgvat asya cāniścayatvāt paryudāse pravṛttir asti na prasajye, meaning that because the sūtra does not specify, it implicitly assumes this principle to cover similar forms in paryudāsa negation, but not in prasajya-pratiṣedha (absolute negation). Nandighoṣavijaya elaborates on this jñāpaka in his Hindi commentary. In yyakye, the word kya is negated. This negation does not cancel every kya indiscriminately but only those forms that are like it kyan, kyang, kyanṣ. It does not extend to unrelated suffixes that may also begin with ‘ya’. This limited but meaningful extension of negation is revealed through the lack of explicit mention in the sūtra, and that omission itself is the indicator that the paribhāṣā is assumed in the background. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri supports this with an additional Bhāṣya reference from bhṛśādibhyo muvyac-cer lopas ca halaḥ (P 3.1.12), where it is stated: “nañ-yuktaṁ iva yuktaṁ vā yad dṛśyate tatasmin tat-sadṛśe kāryaṁ vijñāyate”. This means whatever is negated by nañ leads to the understanding that the negation extends to another similar entity. Thus, the jñāpaka is not an overt qualifier but the natural linguistic behaviour and contextual interpretation.",
      "historicity": "This paribhāṣā has historical roots and arises as an inherent logical and semantic principle rather than an artificially codified rule. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri emphasizes that it is svābhāvika, a natural principle understood by human cognition. The example abrāhmaṇam ānaya shows how everyday language automatically restricts negation to similar entities and does not extend it absurdly to dissimilar items. In grammatical traditon it is discussed for the first time by Kātyāyana and later Patañjali discusses it under the sutra P 3.1.12. The grammarians consider sādṛśya (similarity) as a middle ground between abheda (identity) and anyatva (otherness). This understanding is encapsulated in a traditional verse: tatsādṛśyam abhāvaś ca tad-anyatvaṁ tad-alpatā aprāśasyaṁ virodhaś ca nanarthāḥ ṣaṭ pradarśitāḥ. This verse highlights that similarity is compatible with difference but does not entail complete disjunction. In other words, sādṛśya is relational, it implies functional comparability even when a difference persists. In the Bhāṣya, tat-sadṛśa is linked with a semantic adhikaraṇa, a field of meaning similar to the negated term. Hence, anya-smin tat-sadṛśe arthe refers to another meaning-domain that shares relevant similarity. This is why the negation extends to kyan or kyang as they belong to the same domain of suffixes, but not to yāna as a noun. The historical debate over paryudāsa and prasajya-pratiṣedha further refines the scope of this paribhāṣā. In paryudāsa (restrictive negation), the negation includes similar forms, whereas in prasajya-pratiṣedha (absolute negation), it completely cancels without leaving room for sādṛśya. Hemahansagaṇi considered anato-lup (H 1.4.59) to involve prasajya-nañ, leading to total negation. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri, however, treated it as paryudāsa-nañ based on varṇa-sādṛśya (phonetic similarity), thus maintaining the applicability of the paribhāṣā.",
      "observation": "This paribhāṣā reflects the delicate balance in the grammar between absolute rules and natural cognitive interpretation. Its scope is limited to paryudāsa-type negations, where the negation serves a restrictive function and inherently allows the inclusion of structurally and semantically similar forms. In prasajya-pratiṣedha, which serves pure cancellation, the paribhāṣā has no application. The jñāpaka nature of this principle is significant. The sūtras do not enumerate all similar forms; their silence serves as an implicit pointer that only tat-sadṛśa forms are intended. Thus, the paribhāṣā functions as a bridge between explicit grammatical rules and implicit semantic reasoning. Sādṛśya here is functional similarity, not superficial resemblance. For example, suffixes like kya, kyan, kyang are similar because they belong to the same morphological process, whereas yāna is merely phonologically similar but semantically different, so it is excluded. The paribhāṣā also shows how grammar mirrors human reasoning. In natural cognition, negation never extends to irrelevant domains; it inherently assumes a field of similarity. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri repeatedly stresses that this principle is svābhāvika and arises from loka-siddhi (natural language behavior), thus not requiring formal enforcement by grammar. The apparent anityatva seen in examples like anato-lup is resolved by recognising latent phonetic similarity, as Vijayalāvaṇyasūri argues, or by accepting the broader paryudāsa interpretation rather than prasajya. Hence, the rule maintains internal consistency despite interpretive differences.",
      "conclusion": "The paribhāṣā embodies the inherent selectivity of grammatical negation. It is not a sweeping cancellation but a contextual restriction that naturally extends to similar forms while excluding dissimilar ones. This selectivity is intuitive and mirrors the way negation operates in human cognition and ordinary language. Its scope is primarily in paryudāsa-type negations, and its application is justified through jñāpaka reasoning rather than explicit enumeration in the sūtras. The debates between Hemahansagaṇi and Vijayalāvaṇyasūri on cases like anato-lup highlight interpretive nuances but do not negate the fundamental validity of the rule. It does not appear as a separate nyāya in pāṇinian tradition because it existed as common knowledge, even outside the domain of grammar and hence early grammarians did not include it as a distinct nyāya, and later grammarians seems to have simply followed the precedents of their school. The Haima school, which developed centuries after Pāṇini’s, included it as separate nyāya, possibly because of the need to codify as many nyāya as possible, as paribhāṣā texts had already emerged as separate branch of Sanskrit grammar.",
      "Meaning and Application": "This paribhāṣā establishes that when a word or suffix is negated by nañ (the negation prefix), the negation is not restricted only to the explicitly mentioned word but also extends to other entities that are similar (tat-sadṛśa). It does not, however, extend to entirely dissimilar forms (asadr̥śa). Hemahansagaṇi in Nyāyasaṅgraha formulates it as “nañā uktaṁ padaṁ nañukta-pada-sadṛśe viśeṣya-bhūte pade viśrāmyati”, meaning that the negated word rests in another similar word when that word serves as its qualifier (viśeṣya). In simpler terms, when a negation is applied to a specific form, it also carries over to forms that share relevant structural or functional similarity, but it does not cover items that are completely unrelated. The example cited is the sūtra “yyakye” (1.2.25), where kya is negated. The negation does not apply indiscriminately to every suffix beginning with ‘ya’ but only to suffixes that are similar in structure and function, such as kyan, kyang, and kyanṣ. Therefore, in sentences like gām icchati, nāvaṁ icchati, the suffix kyan brings about the substitution av (gavyati, nāvyati). But in compound words like goyānam (cow-vehicle) or nauyānam (boat-vehicle), the negation does not apply because yāna there is a noun and not a suffix (pratyaya). Thus, negation in this context is selective, encompassing only tat-sadṛśa forms and excluding dissimilar ones. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri clarifies that this is a svābhāvika nyāya, a naturally understood principle rather than a formally codified injunction (viśiṣṭa-vacana). He illustrates this with an example from worldly usage: when someone says abrāhmaṇam ānaya (“bring a non-brāhmaṇa”), one naturally brings someone like a kṣatriya or vaiśya (similar in the category of humans), but no one would bring a piece of wood or a lump of clay. This shows that the mind intuitively associates negation with entities that retain a certain similarity to the negated category, but does not extend it to things entirely alien to it. In this way, the paribhāṣā reflects the natural cognitive process underlying both language and negation."

    "text": {
      "source": "The paribhāṣā is explicitly formulated in Hemahansagaṇi’s Nyāyasaṅgraha as: uktārthānām aprayogaḥ. Hemahansagaṇi illustrates it through kriyate kaṭo’nena. Here, the affixes like kya and the ātmanepada endings already express the karman-relation, so there is no need to add dvitīyā again to kaṭa. Hence only prathamā is retained, resulting in kaṭaḥ kriyate anena rather than kaṭam kriyate anena. The Hindi commentary by Nandighoṣavijaya elaborates this further: jo arth anye pratyay dwārā ukta ho, us arth ko batāne ke liye phir se dvitīyā vā anya vibhakti prayog na ho. Thus if the meaning (abhidheya padārtha) has been indicated by one grammatical operation (like a kṛt-affix), that meaning should not again be reintroduced by a case ending. Hemahansagaṇi also uses akṣṇā kāṇaḥ and padā khañjaḥ to show the exception dictated by lokarūḍhi. Kāṇa inherently means one-eyed, derived from kaṇaṇ nimīlane with ghañ or aṭ, but since blindness pertains only to the eye, the instrumental akṣṇā gets redundantly added in usage. Similarly padā khañjaḥ. The jñāpaka (indirect indicator) supporting this paribhāṣā is seen in Pāṇini’s sūtra ṛṣṛvarṇāt ekapade (2.3.63), where the usage of eka in ekapade indicates a restrictive function. The restriction clarifies that ṇatva applies only in a single undivided word (akhaṇḍapada) like nṛṇām but not in compound clusters like nṛnāthaḥ. If the meaning of “oneness” (ekatva) were the only intention, it would have been clear from the singular itself. Since eka is added redundantly, it must serve a restrictive (niyama) function. This reasoning, Hemahansagaṇi notes, is parallel to the paribhāṣā uktārthānām aprayogaḥ —once a meaning is expressed, it is not stated again unless a rule aims at a different restrictive sense. The Taranga commentary in Nyāyasamuccaya also points out similar cases : In citrāḥ gāvaḥ asya santi, the bahuvrīhi compound already conveys matup (possessive) sense, so the actual matup-affix is not applied. In gargasya gotrāpatyāni, the yan affix for gotra lineage is already expressed, hence yaj is not applied. In saptaparṇaḥ, the sense of “seven” (vīpsā) is already expressed by the compound, so dvirvacana (reduplication) is not performed again. Pāṇini formalises this in the adhikāra anabhihite (2.3.1). The Mahābhāṣya explicitly connects anabhihita with this reasoning: anabhihitaḥ tu vibhaktyarthaḥ, tasmād anabhihita-vacanaṁ meaning case suffixes apply only where their semantic content (number, case relation) has not already been expressed. This matches the paribhāṣā uktārthānām aprayogaḥ. Thus, the pramāṇa for this paribhāṣā in pāṇinian system lies in corroborating statements from the Mahābhāṣya under the sūtra anabhihite.",
      "historicity": "This paribhāṣā is rooted in Pāṇinian tradition. Pāṇini’s system already accounts for avoiding redundancy through rules like anabhihite and the ordering of rules expressing either vidhi (prescription) or niyama (restriction). The Mahābhāṣya, while discussing anabhihite (2.3.1), gives extensive reasoning : If karman etc., themselves were the meanings of case suffixes, their prior expression through kṛt-affixes would block case suffixes. Therefore, ekatva and similar notions (singular, dual, plural) are taken as case-suffix meanings; these remain unexpressed even if karman is expressed by a kṛt-affix. This refined understanding prevents over-blocking of case suffixes and balances the paribhāṣā. Hemahansagaṇi, in the Haima grammatical tradition, inherits this reasoning but aligns it with the Haima ordering of sūtras. He emphasises that while uktārthānām aprayogaḥ ensures grammatical economy, it cannot override lokarūḍhi (colloquial idiom). Hence, forms like akṣṇā kāṇaḥ persist. Historically, this paribhāṣā is also accepted in Vyādi’s Paribhāṣāsūcana and appears in multiple post-Pāṇinian traditions (Śākāṭāyana, Cāndra, Kātantra, Kālāpa). However, later commentators like Sīradeva and Nāgeśa do not list it separately in their Pāṇinian paribhāṣā-saṅgrahas. This indicates its lokasiddha character, treated as self-evident and absorbed into anabhihita rather than retained as an independent nyāya in Pāṇinian school. Vyāḍi illustrates this with an example: if someone says puruṣaḥ, we do not immediately repeat it with another accusative or case word just to reiterate the same meaning; the sense is already understood. Hemahansagaṇi preserves it explicitly in the Nyāyasaṅgraha because the Haima tradition prefers to enumerate even loka-siddha nyāyas separately for clarity.",
      "observation": "This paribhāṣā represents a principle of economy in grammatical derivation. The examples discussed by Hemahansagaṇi—kriyate kaṭo’nena, citrā gāvaḥ santi, gargasya gotrāpatyāni, saptaparṇaḥ—illustrate contexts where meaning expressed by compounds, bahuvrīhis, or kṛt-affixes eliminates the need for additional affixes or case endings. The Taranga commentary expands these examples to show that even when meaning could be redundantly restated, the paribhāṣā blocks it unless colloquial convention dictates otherwise. The exception of lokarūḍhi is crucial. In akṣṇā kāṇaḥ, although kāṇa inherently conveys blindness related to the eye, common speech insists on adding the instrumental akṣṇā. Hemahansagaṇi does not override such usage because lokarūḍhi is resistant to śāstric correction. Thus, the paribhāṣā applies only to derivational contexts, not to well-established idioms. The Mahābhāṣya’s refinement that case suffixes express ekatva, dvitva, bahutva, etc., not the karman itself prevents an overextension of the paribhāṣā. It allows dvitīyā to still appear with adjectives like bhīṣma, udāra, etc., in kaṭam bhīṣmam karoti, because while kaṭa is expressed, its qualified karmabhāva (mat with desired qualities) remains unexpressed, necessitating further case marking. In the Haima system, the jñāpaka from ṛṣṛvarṇāt ekapade clarifies that redundant terms like eka in ekapade indicate restriction (niyama), not simple vidhi. This mirrors uktārtha, when a meaning is already clear (ekatva implied by singular), adding eka must serve restriction, not repetition.",
      "conclusion": "Thus, uktārthānām aprayogaḥ highlights a general epistemic principle: once an operation has fulfilled its semantic purpose, grammar does not repeat it unless for restriction or special clarity. It bridges śāstra and loka by admitting exceptions where idiomatic usage demands otherwise .The paribhāṣā is lokasiddha recognised in everyday usage and later incorporated into the Paribhāṣā texts. While Vyādi and earlier non-Pāṇinian traditions record it explicitly, the later Pāṇinian commentators subsume it under anabhihite. The absence of this paribhāṣā from most of Pāṇinian paribhāṣā shows how Pāṇinian grammar balances economy and clarity, and how later traditions like the Haima preserve even lokasiddha reasoning as formal nyāyas to maintain explanatory completeness.",
      "Meaning and Application": "This paribhāṣā means that “what has already been expressed once should not be expressed again.” More precisely, if a certain semantic function (abhidheya) is already conveyed by one grammatical device (such as a case suffix, an affix, or a compound), then there is no need to reintroduce it through an additional case ending or affix. This is evident in constructions like kriyate kaṭo’nena (“the mat is made by him”), where the kṛdanta affixes (kya, ātmanepada, etc.) already express the karman relation. Therefore, the accusative case (dvitīyā) is not applied again to the word kaṭa to indicate the same function. Instead, in such contexts, only the prathamā is used simply for denoting the referent without reassigning the same semantic load. Similarly, in akṣṇā kāṇaḥ (“he is blind by the eye”), kāṇa as a derivative has already expressed the quality of blindness related to the organ of sight. Hence, the instrumental akṣṇā is theoretically redundant, yet it occurs in practice due to lokarūḍhi, i.e., firmly established colloquial convention, which is resistant to being overridden by śāstric reasoning. This paribhāṣā thus functions as a negative regulation, ensuring the economy of grammatical expression and avoiding superfluous repetition of the same semantic content. It applies only where the meaning is already expressed by a preceding affix or construction, and prohibits subsequent case affixes from expressing the same again. The scope of the paribhāṣā is limited to contexts where the semantic relationship has already been grammatically encoded. It does not cancel usage dictated by lokarūḍhi, where colloquial idiom enforces redundant expressions for communicative clarity or euphony. Hence in the example akṣṇā kāṇaḥ, despite kāṇa already implying blindness related to the eye, the instrumental akṣṇā appears due to customary usage."

    "text": {
      "source": "The Nyāyasaṅgraha explains that while in the external world (loka), the destruction of a cause does not necessarily entail the destruction of its effect—e.g., even if a potter dies, the pots he made remain—in grammar this is different. In grammar, when the nimitta ceases, the naimittika also ceases. Thus it is a purely grammatical convention, intended to maintain consistency in derivational logic. To justify this, Hemahaṁsagaṇi links it to bimba derivations and to the rule of prohibiting sthānivadbhāva (treating substitutes as originals) in n sandhi- (H 7.4.111). This prohibition exists only because if sthānivadbhāva were allowed in this context, it would create undesired further deletions, preventing correct forms like bimbam. This paribhāṣā explains why a prior deletion caused by an affix is restored when that affix is subsequently removed. Nandighoṣavijaya reiterates the same example and explicitly states that this paribhāṣā is invoked because in grammar, unlike in ordinary life, the destruction of the cause leads to the destruction of its dependent operation. He highlights that bimba would not be restored without this rule, and hence this paribhāṣā is indispensable for correct derivations. He also explains its partial non-universality (anityatā): In words like muṇīnām and others, even after a long vowel is substituted, the naimittika nāma substitution arising from the short vowel is not reversed. Its anityatā is indicated by the use of anu in the rule hrasvarasyānunāsike’nuṭ (H 1.3.31), which shows an exception to the general application of this paribhāṣā. Thus the paribhāṣā is not universal but conditional. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri connects this paribhāṣā to the broader principle of akṛtavyūhāḥ (Paribhāṣā 61). He emphasises that this paribhāṣā is subordinate to the akṛtavyūha principle, which governs the mutual dependence of operations in grammar. Nāgeśa, in Paribhāṣenduśekhara, shows that many derivations that seem to rely on this paribhāṣā can alternatively be justified without it, by appealing to antaranga-bahiranga relations and priority rules. There is no discussion on thia nyāya in the Mahābhāṣya and Kaiyaṭa in his commentary on samarthānām prathamādvā (P.4.1.82) remarks that the Mahābhāṣyakāra did not rely on this paribhāṣā.Thus for later scholars, this paribhāṣā is not fundamental but rather an interpretive aid, subordinate to akṛtavyūha-nyāya. Vyādi provides a simple lokaprasiddha example to illustrate: A shadow produced by an umbrella (chattranimitta) disappears when the umbrella is removed. Similarly, in grammar, stauti derived from the dhātu stu loses its intermediate ṭuṭ operation when its nimitta (the ṣṭutva condition) disappears. Haribhāskara in his Paribhāṣāvṛtti draws analogies from Nyāya and Vedānta and Sāhityaśāstra to show the wider philosophical scope: In Nyāya, when apekṣā-buddhi (expectation-cognition) ceases, dvitva (dual awareness) also ceases. In Vedānta, when prārabdha karma is exhausted, the vikṣepa (delusive projection) ceases, and in case of Upādhi-nāśa (destruction of adjuncts), the illusory appearance of red colour in a crystal ceases. Haribhāskara notes that in aesthetic theory, while explaining Bharata’s rasa-sūtra, when discussing rasa as arising from the conjunction of vibhāva, anubhāva, and vyabhicāri, even though one may accept the nimitta-kāraṇatva (causal role) of those factors, their destruction does not cause the destruction of the rasa-pratyaya (aesthetic relish), say the alaṅkārikas. He says, the explicit mention of sthā in the sūtra udha-sthā-stambhoḥ (P.8.4.61) serves as a jñāpaka for this paribhāṣā. Lastly, he concludes that in reality, this paribhāṣā is merely an expansion of akṛtavyūha nyāya. Nīlakaṇṭha Dīkṣita makes the same point as Haribhāskara. He states: Just as in Nyāya the destruction of expectation leads to destruction of dual cognition, or in Vedānta prārabdha-nāśa leads to cessation of delusion, the same holds grammatically. He cites ghumās-sthā (P.6.4.66) as a jñāpaka and considers this paribhāṣā simply a specific elaboration (prapañca) of the akṛtavyūha nyāya.",
      "historicity": "Historically, this paribhāṣā reflects cross-disciplinary reasoning: Lokavyavahāra (common worldly reasoning) says: cause and effect need not always co-exist. A potter (nimitta) may perish, but the pots remain. Grammar, however, aligns with a stricter causal model where cause and effect are inseparable; if the cause ceases, the effect cannot persist. This contrast shows that grammar applies idealised causal relations unlike physical causality. This paribhāṣā is not explicitly acknowledged by Patañjali. Later commentators like Kaiyaṭa and Nāgeśa debated its necessity. Nāgeśa in Paribhāṣenduśekhara suggests that nimitta-abhāva can be accounted for through antaranga-bahiranga priority without postulating a separate paribhāṣā. Although Vyāḍi and other earlier grammarians’ texts recognise this paribhāṣā as a separate nyāya, later grammarians reject its necessity and call it merely an extension of akṛtavyūhaḥ pāṇinīyaḥ.",
      "observation": "Hemahaṁsagaṇi uses this nyāya as a necessary explanatory method to ensure consistency in derivations like bimbam. He ties it to the prohibition of sthānivadbhāva in certain contexts to prevent over-application of deletions. He accepts the anityatā of this nyāya and give (H 1.3.31) as its jñāpaka. Nandighoṣavijaya treats it as a laukika principle adapted for grammar, emphasising its partial applicability (anityatā) as shown in cases like muṇīnām. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri sees it as dispensable, because alternative derivational logic (antaranga–bahiranga relations) can achieve the same outcome. For him, it is subordinate to akṛtavyūha and hence not independently essential. Vyādi’s treatment is the simplest, relying on intuitive causality, while Haribhāskara expands it to philosophical analogies, linking grammar with Nyāya and Vedānta causal theories. Nīlakaṇṭha also merges it into akṛtavyūha,treating it as nothing but a specialised case of the more general dependency of operations .Thus, while universally acknowledged in Haima tradition, its status in the Pāṇinian school is debated.",
      "conclusion": "The paribhāṣā nimittābhāve naimittikasya’pyabhāvaḥ illustrates the grammarian’s stricter causal model, where the dependent operation cannot survive the disappearance of its cause .In the Haima tradition, it is explicitly recognized and applied in crucial derivations like bimbam, safeguarding against over-application of deletions and ensuring correct surface forms. In Pāṇinian tradition, however, its independent necessity is questioned. Mahābhāṣya does not explicitly endorse it; instead, commentators like Kaiyaṭa highlight that Patañjali did not rely on it. Nāgeśa shows how the same outcomes can be justified by other principles, diminishing its foundational status. Philosophically, this paribhāṣā reveals how grammar borrows and adapts causal reasoning from Nyāya, Vedānta, and Mīmāṃsā, yet applies it selectively. The inclusion of this nyāya in Hemahaṁsagaṇi’s Nyāyasaṃgraha shows a necessity to formalise the implicit rules. Later commentators like Haribhāskara and Nīlakaṇṭha either broaden its scope (by linking it to other disciplines) or minimise it, like Vijayalāvaṇyasūri and Nāgeśa. It stands as an instructive example of how linguistic causality in grammar is more idealised than in the external world.",
      "Meaning and Application": "The paribhāṣā nimittābhāve naimittikasya’pyabhāvaḥ asserts that when the cause (nimitta) ceases to exist, the effect (naimittika) that depends on that cause also ceases. In grammatical terms, if a certain grammatical operation (naimittika) arises from a particular trigger or condition (nimitta), then when that triggering condition is removed, the effect does not remain. Hemahaṁsagaṇi illustrates this with an example from the derivation of bimba : From bimba (a plant name), when a feminine form (bimbī) is to be derived, due to gaurādibhyo’ṅīḥ a ṅī-affix is applied, and because of asya ṅyām lukh (P. 2.4.86), the final a of bimba is elided, resulting in bimbī. When this is followed by another derivation bimbāt phalam = bimbam (‘fruit of bimba’), due to hemādibhyo’ñ (P.6.2.58) the aṅ-pratyaya is added, and again, due to ṅyādergauṇasya kvipastaddhitalukyagoṇīsucoḥ (P.2.4.95) the ṅī itself is removed. Now, if the ṅī-affix (which had originally caused the deletion of a in bimba) is itself removed, then the effect caused by it—i.e., the elision of a—must also be reversed. Thus the a reappears, resulting in the form bimba instead of bimbī. This demonstrates that when the nimitta (ṅī-affix) disappears, the naimittika (the elision of a) also disappears. This paribhāṣā thus serves to restore original elements when the causative condition for their removal ceases."

      "source": "The jñāpaka in Hemahaṃsagaṇi’s view is inferred from lack of extra effort : In pañcendraḥ, ān disappears without explicit rule. It must be because ṅī was removed, and ān was co-prescribed. In etān gāḥ, long vowel doesn’t appear, and nātva doesn’t occur either. Hence, by this logic, co-prescribed items are mutually dependent: one’s disappearance kills the other. Nandighoṣavijaya reiterates this, he says in pañcendraḥ, there is no explicit sūtra for removing ān. Yet it disappears automatically when ṅī disappears. Similarly, in etān gāḥ, once śas’s a is removed, the following long vowel (dīrgha) disappears. These act as indirect indicators (jñāpaka). In the Pāṇinian tradition, the wording is slightly different. Vyādi gives it as “saṃnīyogaśiṣṭānām ekatarāpāye ubhayorapyapāyaḥ. He says in bilvakādibhyaś cha lug (P.6.4.153), kuk + cha are prescribed together. If one is removed (cha), kuk also disappears unless explicitly preserved. Thus cha-grahaṇa is a jñāpaka of this paribhāṣā. He explains it using the sutra bilvakādibhyaś cha lug (P.6.4.153). He says, Because while removing a suffix, if it is done, then the saugamaka (secondary dependent element) also gets removed. Thus, how would it apply only to cha? It would also unnecessarily remove k. Therefore, to avoid that, this rule is needed: The kuk and cha are in sanniyoga (connection). If one of the connected elements is removed, both are removed. Thus, in this situation, when there is sanniyoga (connection), if either is removed (anyatarāpāya), both disappear. Therefore, this paribhāṣā must be framed: “sanniyoga-śiṣṭānām anyatarāpāye dvayor apyabhāva”. So Hemahaṃsagaṇi’s wording “ekāpāye’nyatarasyāpyapāyaḥ” differs slightly from Vyādi’s, but the intent is identical when one of two conjoined (sanniyogaśiṣṭa) operations fails; both fail ,. He also references the logical laukika example: devadatta-yajñadattābhyām idaṁ kartavyam; devadattāpāye yajñadatto’pi na karoti —if one of the jointly obligated persons disappears, the action ceases entirely ,.",
      "historicity": "This paribhāṣā is widely known : In Haima tradition, explicit in Nyāyasaṅgraha, later explained by Vijayalāvaṇyasūri and Nandighoṣavijaya. In Pāṇinian tradition, it appears as “anyatarāpāye ubhayorapya-pāyaḥ” in Vyādi, with bilvaka example. Haribhāskara mentions it as laukika nyāya. Nāgeśa in Paribhāṣenduśekhara discusses it but makes it subordinate to akṛtvyuhāḥ pāṇinīyāḥ. In other śāstras, same logic is found: in Nyāya, Vedānta, and even in Sāhitya theory (rasanirūpaṇa), co-cause disappearance leads to effect disappearance, but grammar restricts it to co-prescribed rules. Thus, it originates as a laukika rule imported into grammar but restricted by later paribhāṣās.",
      "observation": "Hemahaṃsagaṇi notes that the paribhāṣā works only when the operations are co-dependent. In pañcendraḥ, ṅī is the trigger for nātva. Remove ṅī → no nātva. In gāḥ, no vowel → no lengthening → no nātva. So true, co-prescription is required. Two forms of cessation:After-application removal (bhūtvā nivṛtti) in pañcendraḥ .Pre-emptive non-arising (mūlataḥ abhāva) in etān gāḥ. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri raises why bahuvacana “sanniyogaśiṣṭānām” is used. Some argued only dual; he clarifies it covers even multiple co-prescribed elements if any one disappears, all linked ones disappear. All commentators agree it is not universal. The very next paribhāṣā nānvācīyamāna-nivṛtto’pi pradhānasya nāpāyaḥ limits it. If it were universal, removal of gauṇa would force removal of pradhāna too, but that next paribhāṣā shows pradhāna survives. Hence this paribhāṣā is anitya (contextual). Vijayalāvaṇyasūri discusses śyeṇeyaḥ / aiṇeyaḥ derivations. Some claimed ṅī’s removal would remove nātva too. But he shows feminine quality remains, so nātva can’t auto-disappear. Puṁvadbhāva is needed to remove feminine status. Thus paribhāṣā does not apply. Vyādi accepts but limits it to co-prescribed structural cases, supported by bilvakādibhyaś cha lug. Nāgeśa in Paribhāṣenduśekhara links it to puṁvadbhāva debates, showing it cannot override primary rules. Hemahaṃsagaṇi: applicable but overruled by next nyāya .Vijayalāvaṇyasūri: partly valid but only for inseparable co-prescription .Vyādi/Nāgeśa: valid only when explicitly inferred from jñāpaka like cha-grahaṇa, not general.",
      "conclusion": "This paribhāṣā can be called as a principle of mutual dependence. When two grammatical operations are jointly enjoined (sanniyoga), the cessation of one, whether through suppression after application (bhūtvā nivṛtti) or through non-arising from the outset (mūlataḥ abhāva), leads to the cessation of the other. Hemahaṃsagaṇi illustrates this effectively with pañcendraḥ, where the removal of ṅī triggers the removal of ān, and with etān gāḥ, where the absence of śas-vowel prevents both the dīrgha and the consequent nātva. Nandighoṣavijaya corroborates this reading and argues that no explicit rule is given for the secondary removal (ān), which clarifies the causal functioning of the paribhāṣā. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri provides additional justification through the Paninian example of bilvakādibhyaś cha lug, where the explicit cha-grahaṇa serves as a safeguard against the unintended disappearance of kuk. Śīradeva’s in his commentary seems to have followed Vyāḍi. However, this nyāya is not universal. It is contextual and subordinate, as shown by the succeeding paribhāṣā (nānvācīyamāna-nivṛtto’pi pradhānasya nāpāyaḥ), which prevents the loss of a principal operation when only an auxiliary or gauṇa element ceases. If this present nyāya were absolute, the pradhāna would always be annulled with the gauṇa, rendering the subsequent restriction redundant. Thus, its application is confined only to those instances where the two operations are inherently co-prescribed and mutually dependent. The Paninian tradition, while retaining the same meaning, frames it slightly differently as saṃnīyogaśiṣṭānām ekatarāpāye ubhayorapyapāyaḥ. Both Vyādi and Nāgeśa discuss it primarily through jñāpaka-s such as bilvaka cha. Vyādi limits its applicability to cases explicitly indicated by such textual hints, rather than adopting it as a blanket rule. Therefore, this paribhāṣā stands as a laukika-derived grammatical principle, admitted into śāstra but moderated by other paribhāṣās and practical exceptions. It shows the layered hierarchy of paribhāṣās where more specific rules can override such generalisations. Its value lies in explaining otherwise unmentioned cessations in derivation, while its anityatva preserves the stability of more primary grammatical processes.",
      "Meaning and Application": "Hemahaṃsagaṇi explains that : sanniyoga means proper simultaneous enjoinment (samīcīnaṁ nitarāṁ yojanam), i.e. two actions prescribed together in one context. Śiṣṭānām are those operations mentioned together, and apāya means cessation or non-arising. When two operations are jointly prescribed, the absence or cessation of one leads to the absence of the other .The Nyāyasaṅgraha stresses that in grammar, this operates differently from worldly logic. In the world, even though two are joined (like twins), one’s death doesn’t cause the other’s death. But in grammar, since the operations are syntactically co-enjoined, if one is suppressed or removed, the other disappears too. Hemahaṃsagaṇi illustrates two forms of abhāva: Bhūtvā nivṛtti – when an operation first applies and is later removed (after-effect disappearance) .Mūlataḥ abhāva – when it never arises in the first place (original non-arising). In pañcendraḥ (pañcendraṇyo devatā asya pañcendraḥ), the aṇ suffix is enjoined by P.6.2.101. But because of dwigor-anapatye yasvarāder lubadviḥ (P.6.1.24), aṇ is removed. That removal triggers removal of ṅī (by P.2.4.95). Since ṅī was the immediate trigger for nātva via varuṇendra-rudra-bhava-śarva-mṛḍādān ca antaḥ (P.2.4.62), nātva also ceases. This is bhūtvā nivṛtti. In etān gāḥ paśya, the vowel o of go would have lengthened via śaso’ta saśca naḥ puṁsi (P.1.4.49). But simultaneously ā aṃśaso’ta (P.1.4.75) already replaces o with ā. Since śas-related a is no longer present, the long vowel doesn’t appear, and therefore the n-change (nātva) does not happen either. This is mūlataḥ abhāva. Thus the paribhāṣā states, when two are tied, and one fails (either by being suppressed after arising or not arising at all), the other tied operation cannot survive."

      "source": "In the Hemacandra sūtra “śaso’ta saśca naḥ puṁsi”, two instructions are given together—one is the dīrgha of a vowel before śas followed by a, and the other is the n-change of śas in masculine contexts. Here the c (ca-kāra) functions as an anvācaya, showing the accessory nature of the n-change relative to the principal dīrgha. Because anvācaya inherently implies secondary association, the accessory does not negate the main rule if it is absent. This c-kāra indicating anvācaya is treated as the jñāpaka, the indicator for the principle. It shows that the gauṇa vidhi is subordinated to the pradhāna and its cessation does not affect the latter. However, the reverse dependence holds: if the principal is absent, the secondary cannot survive. Thus in dhenūḥ the absence of puṃstvatva cancels n-change but not dīrgha; in etān gāḥ paśya the dīrgha itself is the principal, so its absence naturally cancels the dependent n-change.",
      "historicity": "The rule is absent from the Pāṇinian paribhāṣā collections. It survives in Vyādi’s Paribhāṣāsūcana and in Hemacandra’s Haima tradition, demonstrating its older Jain linguistic framework.",
      "observation": "Nandighoṣavijaya explains this paribhāṣā with a analogy from everyday reasoning (nyāya-śāstra). Where there is vyāpaka (the all-pervading cause) its absence leads to the absence of vyāpya (that which is dependent), but the absence of vyāpya does not necessarily imply the absence of vyāpaka. He illustrates with the example of fire and smoke. Where there is no fire (vyāpaka), there is no smoke (vyāpya). But where there is no smoke, it does not necessarily mean there is no fire—for example, a heated iron ball emits no smoke, yet the fire/heat remains. The commentators apply this vyāpaka-vyāpya logic to grammar: the principal operation (dīrgha) is the vyāpaka; its absence causes the gauṇa (n-change) to disappear ,. But the absence of the gauṇa does not cause the principal to vanish. This analogy shows that the relation between principal and secondary operations is asymmetrical and logically determined. Vijaylāvaṇyasūri reinforces this by a practical comparison: a guru instructs a disciple, “bhikṣām aṭa, gām ca ānaya”—go for alms, and also, if you find a cow, bring it. If the disciple goes begging but does not see a cow, he still fulfils the main task (bhikṣā) and is not accused of neglecting the guru’s order. Likewise, if a gauṇa rule cannot apply due to lack of its specific condition, the pradhāna still operates, as it is the independent instruction. The Taranga commentary also examines the internal structure of śaso’ta saśca naḥ puṁsi. It notes that the sūtra actually expresses two sentences: (1) before śas, the vowel becomes long (dīrgha); (2) in masculine contexts, śas changes to nas. The first is principal; only if the first applies does the second accessory rule proceed. Thus, in etān gāḥ paśya, since the main dīrgha cannot operate, the accessory n-change also does not occur. But in dhenūḥ, the main dīrgha is valid, so it operates even if the secondary n-change cannot. Hence the gauṇa rule cannot bind the principal, but the principal may bind the gauṇa. The commentators collectively stress that the c-kāra in the sūtra is not itself a pramāṇika jñāpaka of the paribhāṣā; rather, it reinforces the hierarchical relationship that is already logically evident ,. Vijaylāvaṇyasūri clarifies that if one interprets anvācaya as entirely optional, then the rule would become aiṣṭhika (non-mandatory), which is not desired. Hence the better explanation is that the rule applies only insofar as its nimitta (condition) exists. Where the nimitta for the gauṇa is absent, it ceases, but this does not affect the main operation’s validity. The Taraṅga commentary refutes the idea that this paribhāṣā depends on a jñāpaka like anvācaya to be valid. It argues that this relation between pradhāna and gauṇa is a naturally established logical relationship (nyāya-siddha) and does not require external support from a jñāpaka. Therefore, Hemacandra does not treat this as dependent on any external rule; it stands independently. Another point raised by Vijaylāvaṇyasūri is the treatment of composite sūtras. If a sūtra contains multiple operations, each part has its own scope; the principal one can operate even if the accessory is blocked by the lack of conditions. This makes the paribhāṣā a niyama to avoid overgeneralising the earlier paribhāṣā of sanniyogaśiṣṭa.",
      "conclusion": "This paribhāṣā serves a regulatory role in the Haima grammatical tradition. It establishes that the cessation of a secondary, accessory rule does not invalidate the main rule, while the reverse absence of the main rule, cancelling the secondary, remains logical. The reasoning is supported by both linguistic hierarchy (pradhāna vs gauṇa) and vyāpaka-vyāpya relation. It clarifies the asymmetry of dependency between co-occurring grammatical operations and limits the sweeping effect of the previous paribhāṣā (sanniyogaśiṣṭa). The examples from dhenūḥ, buddhīḥ and etān gāḥ paśya show how the hierarchy is practically applied. The commentaries agree that anvācaya merely reflects this pre-existing logical relationship rather than proving it. While some texts treat anvācaya as the jñāpaka for this principle, Vijaylāvaṇyasūri argues that the principle is nyāya-siddha, a natural logical rule, requiring no further jñāpaka. Its retention in Hemacandra’s system shows its importance in explaining multi-rule sūtras without introducing contradictions or unintended optionality. However, its absence in later Pāṇinian paribhāṣā collections suggests that the Pāṇinian system treats this as common knowledge to handle pradhāna-gauṇa relationships.",
      "Meaning and Application": "The paribhāṣā states that when a secondary or accessory (gauṇa) operation is prevented or ceases to operate, the principal (pradhāna) operation does not necessarily cease. The word anvācīyamāna implies “that which follows” or “that which is accessory or subsequent in priority,” while pradhāna denotes the principal, independent operation. Thus, if the gauṇa-vidhi is blocked or rendered inapplicable, the pradhāna-vidhi still holds, because it has independent primacy. However, the reverse does not hold; if the principal operation ceases, the accessory that depends on it cannot function. The example from Hemacandra’s sūtra system clarifies the application. In buddhīḥ, dhenūḥ and similar words, the absence of puṃstvatva (masculine gender) prevents the accessory rule of śas producing n-change (nattva) as prescribed by śaso’ta saśca naḥ puṁsi, but the principal rule of vowel lengthening (dīrgha) still applies. Thus, the gauṇa n-change is omitted, but the principal dīrgha continues. In other words, the main process (lengthening) does not depend on the existence of the accessory (n-change), whereas the accessory cannot function without the principal. This paribhāṣā negates the yādṛcchika-prāpti (random automatic blocking) that would arise from the previous paribhāṣā “sanniyogaśiṣṭānām ekāpāye anyatarasyāpyapāyaḥ”, which suggested that if one of the jointly specified operations is absent, the other is also absent. Thus the 31st paribhāṣā brings a necessary niyama to regulate the earlier broad statement."

      "source": "The source of this Paribhāṣā , as explained by Hemahaṃsagaṇi, lies in the derivation of nasikāyai hitaṃ nasyam ghṛtam. He contrasts it with nasikyam nagaram. It is supported by the reading of na yi taddhite (2.1.65), where instead of simply saying ye, the sūtra uses yi to signal the exclusion of sānubandha forms. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri suri contradicts Hemahaṃsagaṇi on the jñāpaka given by him. He says that the time required to pronounce ye is two and a half syllabic instants, while it takes only one and a half syllabic instants to pronounce yi. Therefore, to reduce the time taken to pronounce yi has been used in the sūtra, and hence it cannot be jñāpaka for this nyāya. Nandighoṣavijaya explains that this choice between ye and yi in the sūtra is deliberate :If only ye were used, it might imply that both markerless ya and marker-bearing ya (like jya) are included. To prevent that ambiguity, yi was used, so only the markerless ya is intended. In the Pāṇinian tradition, the Mahābhāṣya on vāmadevād ḍyaḍ ḍyau (P 4.2.9) is taken as jñāpaka (indirect indicator). There, the affixes were unnecessarily made ḍit, even though ṭi-lopa was already ensured by yasya iti lopa. This redundant marking serves purely to indicate this principle: Śīradeva further supports this from examples like sadadvyayataḥ yaḥ (P 2.2.11) where the genitive samāsa prohibition applies only to the markerless tavya, not to tavyataḥ which is marked . diva ut (P 6.1.131) where uttva is not triggered for dirbudhātoḥ because the intended pratyaya is the unmarked one . yato’nāvaḥ (P 6.1.213) where yato (with single marking) does not extend to ṇyataḥ (with double marking). Vyādi also formulates it in his Paribhāṣā-sūcana: niranubandhaka-grahaṇe sānubandhakasya grahaṇaṃ na bhavati and gives the jñāpaka (P 4.2.9), which is followed by later grammarians of Pāṇinian tradition like Puruṣottama, Sīradeva, Haribhaskara and others.",
      "historicity": "This nyāya has roots in the Mahābhāṣya, where it is explained in the commentary on vāmadevād ḍyaḍ ḍyau. Patañjali remarks: “ Why the extra ḍakāra? ṭi-lopa would already be achieved by yasya iti lopa.” The conclusion is that the extra marking exists purely to teach a restrictive principle, which later commentators identified as this paribhāṣā. This nyāya is also implied in the Mahābhāṣya on auṅ āpaḥ (7.1.18), where it is stated that mere varṇa-grahaṇa does not create this confusion because there is no competing marker-bearing form. It arises only where markerless and marker-bearing variants coexist as technical terms. Vyādi and later paribhāṣā authors included it in their paribhāṣā-collection, showing it was recognised early in the pāṇinian tradition. Hemahaṃsagaṇi inherit it in the Haima tradition. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri contradicts Hemahaṃsagaṇi and argues that it is not universal (anitya). It does not apply when only letters (varṇa) are mentioned, since no ambiguity exists. It applies only where two or more distinct pratyaya-forms with/without markers could be conflated. This shows that while the principle is old and widely acknowledged, its scope is narrow and bounded by technical necessity.",
      "observation": "The discussion across commentaries reveals a few key points: Deliberate sūtra wording: The choice between ye and yi or adding redundant ḍit markers is purposeful, to indicate this paribhāṣā. Not a blanket rule: It is not meant for mere varṇa-grahaṇa or where only one form exists. Hence, Vijayalāvaṇyasūri restricts its applicability. Not universally nitya: Some later commentators consider it partially valid and context-specific, especially when the following nyāya niranubandhagrahaṇe sāmānyena grahaṇam appears. Linked to anuvāda vs apavāda: It ensures that when anubandhas are dropped in anuvāda or anuvṛtti, the scope is not broadened unintentionally. This Paribhāṣā is often explained along with ekānubandhagrahaṇe na dvyānubandhakasya in the Pāṇinian school.",
      "conclusion": "The paribhāṣā serves a restrictive function in grammatical interpretation. Its main purpose is to make sure that when a sūtra pronounces only a markerless term, it excludes the marked forms even if both share a common base. Its jñāpaka as preserved in the Mahābhāṣya’s explanation of vāmadevād ḍyaḍ ḍyau, where a seemingly redundant ḍit marking is shown to be intentional. Vyādi codifies it concisely; Śīradeva and Hemahaṃsagaṇi apply it to various affix rules in the Pāṇinian and Haima tradition. Nandighoṣavijaya and Vijayalāvaṇyasūri clarify its limited applicability, it is not for basic varṇa-grahaṇa but only for contexts where multiple forms coexist. Thus, the paribhāṣā and maintains the distinction between niranubandha and sānubandha forms.",
      "Meaning and Application": "The paribhāṣā states that when a sūtra mentions a pratyaya, word or affix without its technical anubandhas (i.e., in its simple, markerless form), the rule does not automatically include the same form when it appears with markers (sānubandha). Thus, the scope of the rule is restricted to the exact markerless form uttered in the sūtra, preventing unintended inclusion of other forms. Hemahaṃsagaṇi clarifies this with the case of nasikā in the sūtra ye avarṇe (H 3.2.100). In this sūtra, the markerless ya-pratyaya is taken. Therefore, the nasikāyai hitaṃ nasyam ghṛtam derivation applies. But when the ya-pratyaya is marked with an anubandha, e.g., jya under supanthyādērjyaḥ (H 6.2.84), the same effect does not apply. Hence, nasikyam nagaram is derived differently. The same principle operates in the rule na yi taddhite (H 2.1.65), which denies guṇa/vṛddhi for a ya-pratyaya in taddhita formation. It only affects the markerless ya, not marked forms like jya or others. Without this paribhāṣā, one would erroneously assume that a general ya designation covers all versions of ya-pratyaya, causing overapplication of the prohibition. This paribhāṣā therefore functions as an apavāda (restrictive exception) to block an overgeneralisation that would occur under the natural inclusive reading of sūtras."

      "source": "Hemahaṃsagaṇi defines that when the sūtra mentions only a particular type of marked word (with one anubandha), you cannot extend it to include others having different markings. This nyāya is indicated by the use of plural form in the sūtra 4/3/108. This plural form has been used to denote kyan, kyaṅ, kyaṅṣ and all similar kinds of affixes. All the ky affix would have been denoted even if it was used in singular form; still, the plural form has been used, this has been done keeping the existence of this nyāya in mind ,. Nāgeśa in Paribhāṣenduśekhara explains the jñāpaka (indicator) for this rule is found in vāmadevāḍḍyaḍḍyau (4.2.9) where an extra ḍ was added only to show this exclusion. He says: If you take only one anubandha explicitly, another different anubandha is not included. He also clarifies that this paribhāṣā is not applied when it is simply varṇa-grahaṇa (mentioning a single sound) because in such cases there is no confusion.",
      "historicity": "In Mahābhāṣya, Patañjali refers to this paribhāṣā with a different wording while explaining why a special marker is mentioned when the same result could be derived without it. The extra marking is there only to indicate this restrictive paribhāṣā. Nāgeśa explicitly states that the Pāṇinian system preserves this through jñāpaka-sūtras like yayatoś cātadarthe and vāmadevāḍḍyaḍḍyau. In Haima tradition, Hemahaṃsagaṇi also follows the same in Nyāyasaṅgraha.",
      "observation": "This paribhāṣā is also restrictive in nature. It controls the overapplication of a sūtra. Without it, the rule might wrongly extend its effect to unintended cases. Vijayalāvaṇyasūrī connects this paribhāṣā with the mahābhāṣya reading. In the Pāṇinian system it is worded as, tadanubandhakagrahaṇe nātadanubandhakasya meaning the same if only one marker is explicitly recited; others are excluded. He says the correct reading should follow Pāṇinian tradition because the Hemahaṃsagaṇi style sometimes leads to confusion (like between ekānubandha and dvy-anubandha words). The commentators also clarify its limits: It does not apply when the sūtra merely mentions a single sound (varṇa-grahaṇa). In such a case, there is no confusion of multiple marked variants. Nāgeśa cites auṅ āpaḥ (7.1.18) and Mahābhāṣya on that sūtra to show this. It is not an absolute universal rule. In some contexts, even if only one anubandha is named, a related anubandha may still be included if another paribhāṣā like nir-anubandhagrahaṇe sāmānyena comes later and overrides it. Vijayalāvaṇyasūrī highlights that in Pāṇinian usage, sometimes mutual inclusion still arises when two markers are very similar. Hence, he prefers the Pāṇinian form of the paribhāṣā (tadanubandhakagrahaṇe) because it is clearer.",
      "conclusion": "The paribhāṣā ekānubandha-grahaṇe na dvy-anubandhakasya or tadanubandhakagrahaṇe nātadanubandhakasya serves as a precision tool in grammar. It tells us that when the sūtra cites a specific anubandha, it should not automatically cover a word bearing different anubandha. This maintains clarity and prevents misapplication of rules. It is confirmed by jñāpaka-sūtras like vāmadevāḍḍyaḍḍyau and yayatoś cātadarthe. However, it does not apply when only a bare sound is taken, nor does it operate universally when another inclusive paribhāṣā later overrides it. In both Haima and Pāṇinian traditions, the same reasoning is accepted, though the wording varies.",
      "Meaning and Application": "This paribhāṣā states:When a specific anubandha (marker) is explicitly mentioned in a sūtra, only the words bearing that exact anubandha are included. Words having a different anubandha are not included. In a given sūtra if the operation is occasioned by considering one anubandha, the same operation cannot be caused by considering two or more anubandhas. If a word consisting of an anubandha is taught in a sūtra that same anubandha is there in a word consisting of two, three or more anubandhas then, along with the word consisting single anubandha, words with two, three or more anubandhas could also be denoted by the sūtra. This nyāya is to negate such cases. For example, in the sūtra yyakye 1/2/25 the ya affix with one anubandha has been negated, which is kya affix with an anubandha k directed by sūtra kyaḥ śiti 3/4/70. Therefore, by the strength of this nyāya, the affixes like kyan, kyaṅ, kyaṅṣ and others are not negated because they have more than one affix. For example, in the rule vāmadevāḍḍyaḍḍyau (P 4.2.9), the marking ḍit is applied only to the exact ḍyaḍḍya. This serves as an indicator that in another rule, yayatoś cātadarthe (6.1.156), only these marked forms are excluded. The Mahābhāṣya says: Why is the letter ḍ added here? It makes the form ḍit so that the suffix can be dropped where needed. But actually, even without that ḍ, the result is already obtained by “yasya”–iti-lopa. Hence, the extra ḍ must be there only to indicate this paribhāṣā: when a specific anubandha is mentioned, another one is not included. So the basic application is to prevent over-extension. If the sūtra mentions one specific marker (like anubandha X), you cannot automatically take another marker (like anubandha Y) unless the sūtra itself allows it. This applies in both pratyaya (suffix) contexts and apratyaya (non-suffix) contexts. Nāgeśa explains that it is equally valid in rules dealing with words and in those dealing with suffixes."

      "source": "Nyāyasaṅgraha of Hemahansagaṇi states that asārūpya, anekasvaratva, and anekavarṇatva caused by anubandhas is invalid. The commentary provides examples like aṇ and ḍa affixes. In the rule āto ḍo ’hvā vāmaḥ (5.1.76), ḍa is an apavāda for aṇ (karmaṇo ’ṇ 5.1.72). Without this paribhāṣā, the two would be wrongly treated as asarūpa due to different markers, leading to optionality under asārūpo ’pavāde (5.1.16). But since markers do not create true virūpatva, ḍa overrides aṇ completely as intended. Nandighoṣavijaya’s Hindi commentary explains that this paribhāṣā denies virūpatva arising from markers and maintains the proper utsarga-apavāda relation. It also clarifies examples from kruvṛṣi-mṛji-śaṃsi-guhi-duhi-japo vā (5.1.42), where optionality (vā) is expressly used because ghyaṇ and kyap are not asarūpa due to this paribhāṣā; otherwise, ghyaṇ would wrongly survive.Vijayalāvaṇyasūri’s commentary elaborates the Mahābhāṣya’s debate on whether anubandhas are avayavas of bōdhya (applied form) or only of bōdhaka (instructional form). The Mahābhāṣya (on tasya lopaḥ 1.3.9) says that anubandhas are perceived only in the instructional stage, like a tree’s branch perceived only when attached to the tree. Hence, any form difference arising solely from them is not functionally real in prayoga. Mahābhāṣya in the discussion of tasya lopaḥ, the Bhāṣyakāra explicitly debates the avayava nature of anubandhas and concludes that in the actual prayoga they do not remain, so they cannot produce operational virūpatva, anekasvaratva, or anekavarṇatva. Nāgeśa’s Paribhāṣenduśekhara gives three paribhāṣās, each with specific sūtra-based jñāpaka:anekāltva linked to śid grahaṇa (P 1.1.55) anejantatva linked to udīcāṃ māṅaḥ (P 3.4.19) asārūpya linked to vā’sarūpa (P 3.1.94) and dadāti dadhāti vibhāṣā (P 3.1.139)",
      "historicity": "This paribhāṣā is acknowledged in the Haima grammatical tradition. Hemahansagaṇi, Nandighoṣavijaya, and Vijayalāvaṇyasūri all uphold it as necessary for preserving the precision of affix application and rule hierarchy. In the Pāṇinian tradition, related discussions occur in the Mahābhāṣya, especially regarding the avayavatva of anubandhas. However, explicit wording of this paribhāṣā appears mainly in the Haima sources. Different grammatical schools have partial treatments: Vyādi includes only asārūpya and anekavarṇatva, but not anekasvaratva. In Chāndra and Jaina traditions, only partial aspects appear, showing this principle was refined gradually and fully consolidated in the Haima tradition.",
      "observation": "The paribhāṣā serves two main purposes:Preserving utsarga-apavāda hierarchy. If anubandha-based virūpatva were accepted, an utsarga like aṇ would wrongly coexist with its apavāda ḍa, forcing optionality (asārūpo ’pavāde). This paribhāṣā avoids that by considering them sarūpa.Restricting overextension of rules:If anekasvaratva and anekavarṇatva caused by markers were recognised, rules like dhātor anekasvarāt (3.4.46) or anekavarṇaḥ sarvasya (7.4.107) would wrongly over-apply. Thus, this paribhāṣā ensures that only actual phonetic forms matter, not marker-induced complexity. The Mahābhāṣya analogy like a branch only visible while attached to the tree captures the logic: anubandhas belong to the upadeśa stage, not to the realised linguistic form. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri’s commentary also highlights that without this paribhāṣā, abheda-nirdeśa like ṣyā putra-patyoḥ kevalayor īc tatpuruṣe (H 2.4.83) would become redundant. Its presence indicates that marker-based varṇa multiplicity is ignored.This paribhāṣā therefore removes unnecessary distinctions, avoids unintended optionalities, and clarifies why explicit markers like vā are needed in some places.",
      "conclusion": "The paribhāṣā clarifies that instructional markers (anubandhas) are pedagogical tools and do not create genuine morphological, phonetic, or accentual differences. This prevents the misinterpretation of sarūpa forms as virūpa, stops redundant optionalities in utsarga-apavāda relations. After looking at the evolution of this paribhāṣā, we can conclude that later grammarians like Puruṣottama and Nāgeśa were more systematic, because they treat each domain separately, which allows them to attach specific sūtras and jñāpaka as evidence. This made their explanations tighter but also fragmented. It also reflects a deeper philosophical understanding from the Mahābhāṣya: anubandhas are perceived only in the teaching framework, not in the actual usage. Hence, they cannot influence the real form. This makes it an important interpretative principle for providing clarity between instructional notation and real linguistic forms.",
      "Meaning and Application": "This paribhāṣā asserts that any apparent difference in form, accent, or phonetic length that arises solely because of anubandhas (markers used in grammatical instruction) cannot be taken as valid in determining grammatical operations. Asārūpya (virūpatva, asadṛśatva) refers to dissimilarity of form. For instance, the affixes aṇ and ḍa differ in their instructional representation because of different anubandhas (ṇ and ḍ), but when these markers are removed, both reduce to the same phonetic form ‘a’. Thus they are sarūpa in reality. The paribhāṣā prevents treating them as asarūpa merely because of the different markers. Anekasvaratva refers to the presence of multiple accents caused by markers. In dhātupāṭha, roots like ḍupacīṃṣ appear to have multiple accents due to the attached markers, but in the actual prayoga forms like papāca, the multiple accents are not recognised for operations such as dhātor anekasvarāt (3.4.46). Hence, anubandha-based multiple accents are ignored. Anekavarṇatva refers to multiple letters due to markers. For example, in vana and ghuṇi, when markers like ṅ are present, they might falsely appear as multiple varṇa forms. If these were accepted, by the rule anekavarṇaḥ sarvasya (7.4.107) the entire root would undergo substitution. However, due to this paribhāṣā, only the actual phonetic varṇa (without markers) is considered; thus ṣaṣṭhyāntyasya (7.4.106) applies only to the final consonant. This paribhāṣā hence stops unintended consequences like unwanted optionality between utsarga and apavāda affixes, unnecessary blocking of substitutions, or overextension of rules caused purely by anubandha markers."

      "source": "Hemahaṃsagaṇi in Nyāyasaṅgraha gives detailed examples for each of the six categories: Samāsānta: bahvāpam (bahv + ap) should yield bahvampī by ṛk-pūḥ pathy-apo’t (H 7.3.76), but prayoga shows both bahvāpam and bahvampī. Hence samāsānta suffix at is not nitya. Āgama: paṭṭā/paṭitā from paṭ dhātu shows optional iṭ even though paṭ is set. Similarly pach/skand in paktā/pacitā where they are anit set but still take iṭ. dhāvitaḥ/dhotaḥ shows iṭ optionality even though dhāv is ūdit. jabhati/jajbhīti differ despite same sūtra (jabhah svare 4.4.100). Saṃjñā-nirdiṣṭa: cakāsāmās in parokṣa sense should give ām by dhātor anekasvarāt (H3.4.46), but in dadaridrāu it doesn’t appear though parokṣa sense is there. Hence parokṣa-saṃjñā based kārya is anitya. Jñāpaka-nirdiṣṭa:e.g., ṛg-ayana —even though ag is added in pūrvapadasthān nāmnyag (H 2.3.64) to block ṇatva, it still can appear. Similarly daśaika-daśa shows adanta by sūtra but prayoga gives both daśaikādaśān and daśaikādaśān with or without adanta implication. Gaṇa-nirdiṣṭa: kuṭita/kuṭitum with kuṭādér ṅit-vad aṇṇit (H 4.3.17) gives ṅit but in vyachit/vivya-cithaḥ same gaṇa ṅit is not applied. Nañ-nirdiṣṭa: krung vāste/krungvāste and kimvāvapana show differing nasalisation. Though nañ-based padatva is prescribed, in practice sometimes it doesn’t hold. Nandighoṣavijaya’s commentary reaffirms each example in simpler terms. He clarifies that though the sūtra would expect a nitya result, prayoga varies. For instance, bahvāpam/bahvampī shows samāsānta suffix sometimes omitted. paṭṭā/paṭitā shows iṭ optionality despite a clear setting. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri in Taranga does not give all examples but critiques the notion that all six are equally anitya. He suggests some (like samāsānta) clearly show prayoga-based optionality, while others, like gaṇa-based or nañ-nirdiṣṭa may still be nitya in their specific scope. Thus, he resists overgeneralisation of anityatva.",
      "historicity": "Historically, the notion of anityatva for certain kāryas is not unique to Haima tradition. In the Mahābhāṣya, discussions exist on anityatva of āgama and samāsānta usage. However, Hemahaṃsagaṇi’s formulation is distinctive because it consolidates six disparate domains into a single paribhāṣā. Later grammarians like Nāgeśa in Paribhāṣenduśekhara break this into multiple smaller paribhāṣās—e.g., āgamaśāstram anityam,, etc. This shows that in Haima tradition, Hemahaṃsagaṇi preferred a unified explanation for prayoga deviations, whereas later grammarians refined it into more precise domains. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri also aligns more with Paninian gradual refinement, criticising excessive anityatva.",
      "observation": "After analysing the Nyāyasaṅgraha and subsequent commentaries, we observe that Prayoga-darśana (usage evidence) is primary. Hemahaṃsagaṇi uses real-life examples like bahvāpam/bahvampī or dhāvitaḥ/dhotaḥ to show that grammar allows actual variation. He implies that Sūtra application does not have universal enforcement. Even when a sūtra like ṛkpūḥ pathyapo’t or dhātor anekasvarāt applies, prayoga sometimes omits the expected suffix/āgama. Optionality vs non-application, both are recognised. In some cases (paṭṭā/paṭitā) it is truly optional; in others (ṛgayanam) the kārya is simply absent despite conditions. This paribhāṣā prevents over-rigidity. Without it, many attested forms would seem incorrect or “ungrammatical.” It legitimises that sūtra-based kāryas are sometimes suspended. However, overextending anityatva risks weakening rule authority. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri is against declaring all six uniformly anitya. He says that using this nyāya to fully proclaim their anityatva is not proper, because by showing anityatva, you just reconfirm that some apply occasionally (kvācitkva) but most remain nitya anyway. Thus, anityatva is only to justify iṣṭa-prayoga (desired forms), so taking refuge in anityatva again is redundant. In the Pāṇinian tradition, Nāgeśa in Paribhāṣenduśekhara listed similar nyāyas like saṃjñā-pūrvakam anityam, āgama-śāstram anityam, gaṇa-kāryam anityam, etc., and then rejects them, on the basis that they are not found in the Mahābhāṣya.",
      "conclusion": "The 35th paribhāṣā samāsāntāgama-saṃjñā-jñāpaka-gaṇa-nañ-nirdiṣṭāny-anityāni serves as a unifying principle in Haima grammar to explain why six specific kinds of grammatical operations—samāsānta suffixes, āgamas, saṃjñā-based operations, jñāpaka-inferred rules, gaṇa-based operations, and nañ-nirdiṣṭa rules do not always operate universally despite being prescribed by sūtras. Hemahaṃsagaṇi, by grouping them under one paribhāṣā, highlights the pragmatic flexibility of Haima grammar. Nandighoṣavijaya supports this by showing many concrete examples where expected operations fail, thereby justifying the label anitya.However, Vijayalāvaṇyasūri’s Taranga commentary cautions against overgeneralising anityatva. He suggests some categories genuinely exhibit optionality (like samāsānta, āgama), while others (like gaṇa-nirdiṣṭa or nañ-nirdiṣṭa) remain regular in their domain. Later Paninian traditions further split these into distinct paribhāṣās rather than one broad statement, reflecting a historical refinement from a generalised to a more specific understanding of anityatva. Thus, this paribhāṣā embodies Hemahaṃsagaṇi’s inclusive approach to account for prayoga variation, but it was later rejected and segmented in post-Haima traditions to maintain a tighter rule structure.",
      "Meaning and Application": "This paribhāṣā states that six types of grammatical operations are not universally fixed (anitya). They are: samāsānta – operations relating to samāsānta suffixes (endings of compounds), āgama – augment insertions like iṭ, ṇum, m etc., saṃjñā-nirdiṣṭa – rules dependent on technical terms like parokṣa-saṃjñā, jñāpaka-nirdiṣṭa – rules inferred from indirect jñāpaka indicators, gaṇa-nirdiṣṭa – rules dependent on specific gaṇas (lexical lists), nañ-nirdiṣṭa – rules dependent on nañ-nirdiṣṭa (negatively specified forms). The paribhāṣā implies that though grammar prescribes these operations through sūtras, they are not absolutely universal. They occur in some usages but not in others, even under similar conditions. This contradicts the presumption that once a rule is prescribed, it is always applicable (nitya). Hemahaṃsagaṇi frames it as an apavāda to the general principle sarvaṃ vākyaṃ sāvadāraṇam —normally whatever is stated by a sūtra is universally applicable unless restricted. But this paribhāṣā asserts that in practice, samāsānta, āgama, and similar rules are sometimes absent even where expected. Nandighoṣavijaya reinforces this meaning, these six kāryas, despite being expected from sūtras, are occasionally missing in actual prayoga. Thus, the paribhāṣā justifies such prayoga as anitya, not violating grammar. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri accepts the basic meaning but highlights that this anityatva is not uniform, some are truly optional in usage, others are nitya for specific domains."

      "source": "In the Nyāyasaṅgraha, Hemahansagaṇi relies entirely on the sequence of sūtra presentation in Hemacandra’s Śabdānuśāsana to infer this paribhāṣā. He interprets the way sak, aṅ, and ṇic are placed sequentially as the jñāpaka (indicator) for this principle. He states that the arrangement of these rules suggests that only aṅ is intended to be negated by sak, and ṇic is meant to remain valid. Nandighoṣavijaya, in his Hindi commentary, agrees with Hemahansagaṇi but expands the reasoning by emphasizing the logic of vyāpya-vyāpaka-bhāva (contained and container relationship) between sak and aṅ. He observes that the subject matter of sak is narrower (limited to the root śliṣ), while the subject of aṅ is broader (covering roots like lud, dvi, dyut etc., which also include śliṣ). Thus, sak can logically act as an apavāda for aṅ because it targets a subset of the same domain. However, sak and ṇic have entirely different operational domains: ṇic is restricted to bhāva (state) and karma (object), which are separate from kartari usage where sak applies. Since their fields do not overlap, there can be no relation of apavāda between sak and ṇic. Vijays Lavanyasūri in his Taranga commentary critiques the simplistic jñāpaka approach. He points out that the mere sequence of sūtras cannot by itself justify this principle because, in the Hemacandra system, sūtra arrangement also considers grouping of logically unrelated rules for convenience. He compares this to the Paninian tradition, where apavāda always follows utsarga, the general rule. He suggests that the sequence was designed with an underlying purpose: first stating the utsarga (sich), then sak as a limited apavāda for aṅ, followed by ṇic which operates in a separate domain. Therefore, the placement cannot be taken as an absolute indicator; it is an intentional structuring based on functional necessity. When we compare this with Nāgeśa Bhaṭṭa’s Paribhāṣenduśekhara, a similar but differently worded paribhāṣā is found: “purastād apavādāḥ anantarān vidhīn bādhante nottarān” (Paribhāṣenduśekhara 60). Nāgeśa explains it in the context of pararūpatva (replacement effects) and ākāṅkṣā (syntactic expectation). According to him, an apavāda always serves the purpose of overriding an immediately connected vidhi because beyond that proximity, the expectation of contradiction fades, and there is no māna (valid cognition) for extending the negation further. He notes that in cases like pararūpa-sandhi where later rules appear, the earlier apavāda does not automatically cancel them because its force ends once the immediate requirement is fulfilled. Thus, across Hemahansagaṇi, Nandighoṣa, Lavanyasūri, and Nāgeśa, the source and rationale converge: the proximity of sūtras and the domain overlap determine the scope of an apavāda.",
      "historicity": "The principle shows the Haima grammatical tradition’s concern with sūtra-sequence interpretation. Hemahansagaṇi purpose is to ensure that exceptions are applied only as far as they are contextually needed, and not beyond, so that pramāṇa-bala (the force of authority) of later vidhi rules is not unnecessarily disturbed. However, the idea has older roots in the Pāṇinian tradition as well. In the Mahābhāṣya, there are instances where Patañjali comments on the necessity of placing an apavāda immediately after its utsarga to maintain logical clarity. The Mahābhāṣya also notes that where sūtras are separated by other unrelated rules, the earlier apavāda does not logically override the later separated rule unless explicitly mentioned. Nāgeśa Bhaṭṭa inherits this reasoning in the Paribhāṣenduśekhara and formulates it in a more systematic way. Yet, Hemahansagaṇi adapts it to the Haima system with a slightly different emphasis. In Hemacandra’s Śabdānuśāsana, the order of sak, aṅ, and ṇic is deliberate to show sak cancelling only aṅ and not ṇic. Hence, the historical evolution shows an increased concern with the scope limitation of apavāda, preventing overreach and maintaining stability of other rules. This paribhāṣā is therefore not unique to the Haima tradition but represents a grammatical tendency of removing any doubt in order of rule application.",
      "observation": "Hemahansagaṇi bases the principle on the sūtra arrangement or sequence as the jñāpaka. He believes that the proximity indicates the intended scope of negation. Nandighoṣa expands this explanation arguing that sak and aṅ share vyāpya-vyāpaka relationship, while sak and ṇic do not. Vijaya Lavanyasūri, however, critiques the overreliance on textual proximity and suggests that the order of sūtras itself was purposefully structured with the broader logic of utsarga and apavāda in mind, and therefore should not be read as an accidental clue. When compared with Nāgeśa’s formulation in the Paribhāṣenduśekhara, we find Nāgeśa’s focus is on ākāṅkṣā, once an immediate contradiction is resolved, the apavāda’s purpose ends. Further application to distantly related rules lacks māna (epistemic validity). An interesting observation is that this paribhāṣā is considered anitya by Lavanyasūri. He cites examples like śiśriyur and yavakriyā where later, even separated, rules do get cancelled. He thus argues that there are counter-examples where vyavahita rules are also negated, indicating that the paribhāṣā is not universally applicable but context-sensitive. Hemahansagaṇi does not address these exceptions, but Lavanyasūri insists that this limitation must be recognised to avoid absolutist interpretation. Thus, the Haima and Paninian traditions differ subtly. While both agree on the necessity of proximity for apavāda, the Paninian school (through Nāgeśa) articulates it as a general cognitive principle, whereas the Haima school ties it more to sequence and where sūtras overlap.",
      "conclusion": "The shows an important principle in the layered hierarchy of grammatical rules. It shows that even an exception (apavāda) has a limited scope of negation, confined to those rules which immediately follow it and belong to the same functional domain. It does not extend its negating force to later rules that are separated by unrelated prescriptions unless explicitly designed to do so. Hemahansagaṇi’s reasoning is grounded in the sequential logic of sūtra arrangement. Nandighoṣa adds a semantic-domain-based justification, and Lavanyasūri provides a critical revision, showing its anityatva (non-universality) with counterexamples. Nāgeśa’s Paribhāṣenduśekhara aligns conceptually but frames it in a general of ākāṅkṣā and māna. Therefore, the paribhāṣā functions as a guideline for interpreting sūtras and their exceptions but is not an absolute rule. It is context-sensitive, applying only when an apavāda and its utsarga are closely related both in placement and in domain. Where this proximity is absent, or where the domain does not overlap, the negation ceases.",
      "Meaning and Application": "This paribhāṣā means that a previously stated apavāda (exception or restrictive rule) will only invalidate or override those vidhi-sūtras (general rules) which immediately follow it in the textual sequence, but it does not extend its power of negation to those vidhi rules which are separated by other intermediate rules. The scope of the earlier exception is therefore limited to anantara-vidhi, i.e., those rules directly succeeding it in the textual order, and it does not operate on vyavahita-vidhi, rules that are farther away or intervened by other prescriptions. Hemahansagaṇi explains that this principle is intended to prevent an over-extension of an exception’s reach. Once an apavāda is uttered in the sūtra order, it has the immediate purpose of negating a nearby or directly subsequent vidhi, but it cannot “jump over” other rules and negate those which are not in immediate proximity. If such unrestricted reach were allowed, any previously stated apavāda could end up nullifying later rules irrespective of their structural placement, which would lead to chaos in the logical reading of the sūtra text. An example is provided to clarify this principle. Consider the rule “śliṣaḥ” (3.4.56), which prescribes the sak pratyaya. Immediately after this comes “puṣyādyaṅ” (3.4.64), prescribing the aṅ pratyaya. Here the earlier sak acts as an apavāda, negating the immediate aṅ rule. But it does not go on to invalidate “bhāva-karma-ṇic” (3.4.68), which is separated from the sak by intervening rules. Thus, in a sentence like āśliṣṭa-kanyāṃ caitraḥ (Chaitra embraced the girl), the aṅ rule is overridden by sak due to its immediate sequence, but in āśliṣi kanyā caitreṇa (the girl was embraced by Chaitra), the ṇic rule applies without being nullified, because it is separated (vyavahita) from the sak in the sūtra order. This example illustrates the intended application of the principle: a rule stated earlier can only negate a directly succeeding rule, not those that are distanced by other prescriptions. Hemahansagaṇi notes that the ordering of the sutras, sak, aṅ, and ṇic indicates this. If the sequence had been different, such as placing the sak after aṅ, the sak would then have negated both aṅ and ṇic, leading to an undesired result."

      "source": "Hemahansagaṇi in Nyāyasaṅgraha explain this paribhāṣā with the example of brahmabrūṇavṛtrāt kvip. He notes that while kvip negates the earlier rules (karmaṇo’ṇ, brahmādibhyaḥ ṭak, and hano ṇin), it does not affect the later kta-ktavatU. The application is demonstrated through derivational outputs: forms like brahma-ghātaḥ, brahma-ghnaḥ, and brahma-ghātī do not arise because kvip intervenes, but brahma-hatavān remains valid because kta-ktavatU lies beyond kvip in the sūtra order. Nandighoṣavijaya, in his Hindi commentary, elaborates on the logical placement of the apavāda. He emphasizes that a madhya-stha (middle-positioned) apavāda operates only upon the preceding rules. He also adds an important philosophical reasoning: the bādhakatva-bīja (the causal potency for cancellation) of an apavāda becomes exhausted after fulfilling its immediate purpose; thus, it lacks any residual potency to affect later rules. He further invokes the spardhe principle (H. 7.4.119), which deals with rule-competition, to explain that once a conflict is resolved with the earlier rules, there remains no ākāṅkṣā (logical expectancy) for further cancellation. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri offers another layer of analysis. He regards this paribhāṣā as an intentional limitation imposed by the textual order. Normally, an apavāda could, by its nature, nullify all utsarga rules. But when a sūtrakāra deliberately places it in the middle, it signals a restricted scope: it is meant only to negate what precedes. He contrasts two interpretive perspectives: the prācīna view, which sees this placement as a pragmatic pedagogical choice to achieve specific derivational goals, and the more critical view, which understands the paribhāṣā as codifying a conventional interpretive constraint rather than a natural consequence. Nāgeśa Bhaṭṭa in Paribhāṣenduśekhara explain the same paribhāṣā as: purastād apavādā anantarān vidhīn bādhante no’ttarān. The Mahābhāṣya too, explain on similar reasoning when discussing the mutual competition (vipratiṣedha) of rules, especially in the nāsikodara section (4.1.55). There, it illustrates how middle-apavādas only affect earlier competing rules and leave later rules intact. Thus, this paribhāṣā in Nyāyasaṅgraha aligns with and extends older Paninian discussions.",
      "historicity": "Historically, this paribhāṣā belongs to a triadic framework concerning the relative placement of apavāda rules. It is the second in sequence: the first deals with apavādas placed before (pūrve’pavādāḥ anantarān vidhīn bādhante no’ttarān), the present one deals with apavādas placed in the middle, and the third (to follow) will deal with apavādas placed after. This framework highlights the ancient grammarians’ nuanced understanding of textual sequence (sūtra-krama) as an interpretive tool. Interestingly, this paribhāṣā does not appear in the paribhāṣā collections of Vyādi, Kātantra, or Kālāpa traditions. Its absence there suggests it is not a universal axiom across all schools but rather a later refinement, more typical of the Haimavyākaraṇa tradition and the interpretive style of Nāgeśa Bhaṭṭa and Hemahansagaṇi. It shows a shift toward finer, more context-sensitive analyses of vipratiṣedha (rule-conflict). In Paninian grammar, the Mahābhāṣya supports similar reasoning indirectly, and Nāgeśa formalizes it, but Hemahansagaṇi applies it systematically as a nyāya. Therefore, this paribhāṣā represents a mature stage of grammatical meta-theory. It emerges as grammarians began to refine the scope of apavāda rules, realizing that unlimited bādha would destabilize the derivational hierarchy. By the time of Hemahansagaṇi, such interpretive refinements had become necessary to preserve textual economy and internal consistency.",
      "observation": "The example of brahmabrūṇavṛtrāt kvip clearly illustrates the restricted scope. When kvip intervenes, it cancels forms like brahma-ghātaḥ, brahma-ghnaḥ, and brahma-ghātī, but allows brahma-hatavān. This is not an accidental outcome but a deliberate interpretive safeguard. Without this paribhāṣā, one might incorrectly assume that kvip nullifies all bhūta-related rules, including kta-ktavatU, leading to loss of legitimate forms. The commentaries also point out the logical exhaustion of apavāda potency. An apavāda is introduced to resolve a specific conflict; once that conflict is resolved, it no longer has a competing scope. There is no ākāṅkṣā, or unmet necessity, left to justify extending its negation forward. This reflects the grammatical principle of limited competition (spardhā) rules compete only within their immediate domain, not indefinitely. Another important observation is that the textual order of sūtras itself communicates interpretive intention. The sequence aṇ → ṭak → ṇin → kvip → ktavatU is not arbitrary; it reveals a layered hierarchy of increasing specificity. The middle-positioned kvip targets only the earlier utsarga but not the subsequent ktavatU. Thus, sūtra-krama acts as a meta-linguistic signal, which this paribhāṣā decodes. On the question of whether the paribhāṣā is nitya (absolute) or anitya (contextual). Hemahansagaṇi suggests it is not anitya—it is a stable principle because derivational examples consistently align with it. But newer grammarians argue that in some contexts, particularly where spardhā logic dominates, later rules can still be overridden. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri leans toward interpreting it as an intentional but context-bound convention.",
      "conclusion": "This paribhāṣā reflects the balance maintained in Sanskrit grammar between general and exceptional rules. It establishes that a middle-positioned apavāda cancels only preceding rules, preserving the application of later ones. By doing so, it prevents overreach of exceptions and maintains a layered derivational order. The derivational example of brahmahā versus brahma-hatavān demonstrates its immediate practical effect. The supporting reasoning from Nandighoṣavijaya and Vijayalāvaṇyasūri highlights both logical exhaustion (nirvakāśatva) and intentional textual design. Historically, it complements the triadic framework of paribhāṣās about apavāda placement and shows the evolution of meta-rules within the Haimavyākaraṇa system. In broader theoretical terms, this paribhāṣā teaches that exceptions are not infinite disruptors; they are carefully scoped interventions. It also underscores the importance of sūtra sequence as an interpretive cue in Sanskrit grammar, demonstrating how even the placement of a rule carries meaning beyond its literal content. While not universal across all traditions, it reflects a sophisticated, context-sensitive grammar that balances logical necessity, textual economy, and practical derivation.",
      "Meaning and Application": "The paribhāṣā expresses a interpretive principle in the structure of grammatical rules. When an apavāda, i.e., an exception rule, is positioned between other rules—specifically, between earlier and later utsarga (general) rules—it overrides only the rules stated before it, not those stated after it. In simpler terms, the power of an exception is directionally limited when it appears in the middle of a sequence: it nullifies preceding rules but does not extend its negating influence forward to cancel subsequent rules. The primary illustration given by Hemahansagaṇi involves the affix kvip prescribed by the sūtra brahmabrūṇavṛtrāt kvip (P. 5.1.161). In the past-tense meaning, when the objects brahma, brūṇa, or vṛtra are combined with the root han “to kill,” this rule prescribes the affix kvip, resulting in forms like brahmahā (“killer of a brāhmaṇa”). However, several other affixes—aṇ from karmaṇo’ṇ (5.1.72), ṭak from brahmādibhyaḥ (5.1.85), and ṇin from hano ṇin (5.1.160)—would otherwise apply for such contexts. The kvip rule acts as an apavāda overriding these earlier general or semi-specific rules. But crucially, kvip does not override kta-ktavatU (5.1.174), which is a later rule prescribing ktavatU for bhūta (past) sense, resulting in forms like brahma-hatavān. Thus, the middle-positioned kvip only cancels the preceding affixes aṇ, ṭak, and ṇin, but does not cancel the later-placed ktavatU. This illustrates the paribhāṣā’s precise functional limit. This rule is therefore necessary to prevent an overextension of an apavāda’s scope. Without it, one might mistakenly assume that any exception negates all competing rules, both before and after it, potentially leading to a collapse of subsequent rule functions. The paribhāṣā safeguards the autonomy of later rules and preserves a structured sequence of application."

      "source": "Hemahansagaṇi provides these paribhāṣās in Nyāyasaṅgraha as part of the section dealing with process termination and the hierarchy of operations. He illustrates anarthaka upadeśa with two contexts: Uṇādi words like tad, tyad, yad. Since the forms are already derived, any further ḍa-affix would not yield a new valid form. Hence ḍhuṭas tṛtīyaḥ (P. 2.1.76) is overridden. Second, repetitive lopa operations, as in sañcaskāra, where after reduplication, multiple occurrences of sasṭ lopa become unnecessary. Nandighoṣavijaya clarifies this point by emphasizing that in Vyākaraṇa, unlike in the external world (e.g., where even purposeless phenomena like untimely rain happen), the śāstra is purely purposive. Therefore, a rule cannot operate if its application yields no tangible or logical consequence. The paribhāṣā acts as a safeguard against infinite regress or endless grammatical processes (vyāpāra-anūparama). If a rule is applied without purpose, then the grammatical process would never terminate, and the pada would never reach its final stabilized form (pariniṣṭhitatva). Thus, the paribhāṣā ensures upasamhāra—a definite conclusion in the derivation. Vijayalavaṇyasūri, however, takes a more critical stance. He argues that these paribhāṣās (38–39) are not independent but are derivative of a deeper paribhāṣā mentioned later: yena nāprāpte yo vidhir ārabhyate sa tasyaiva bādhakaḥ. He reasons that the logic of anarthaka upadeśa is not primary, because the Mahābhāṣya elsewhere has already established the principle that the śāstra, like fire, acts only as far as necessary, agnivat. In the Mahābhāṣya on iko jhal (P. 1.2.9), it is said: “akṛtakāri khalvapi śāstram agnivat”—just as fire does not burn again what is already burnt, similarly a grammatical rule does not reapply on something that has already been processed. Thus, the prevention of infinite application (anūparama) is already handled by that principle. Vijayalavaṇyasūri further argues that if a rule is considered completely purposeless, then why would the śāstra even mention it? He says the application of ḍhuṭas tṛtīyaḥ in tacchāru or tad cannot be wholly purposeless—it still has its place in the logical ordering of rules, even if it does not visibly alter the form. Moreover, the second paribhāṣā (39) makes this clearer as long as the nimitta exists, a rule should not be considered overridden. So both 38 and 39, according to him, are commentarial derivatives from the more fundamental rule about bādhakatva that will be introduced later. The succeeding paribhāṣā “yasya tu vidher nimittam asti nāsau bādhyate” is complementary. It asserts that if there is a valid cause (nimitta) for the application of a rule, it cannot be considered overridden. In other words, if the rule has a legitimate ground of application which produces a meaningful grammatical effect, it remains in force. Together, these paribhāṣās define a logic of relevance in rule application: A rule becomes overridden when its application is purposeless. But if there is a valid trigger (nimitta) producing a meaningful grammatical consequence, the rule must apply.",
      "historicity": "Historically, the idea of anarthaka upadeśa emerges from the tension between two fundamental grammatical principles: Śāstra always produces a meaningful result (prayojana). If a result is already obtained, further reapplication of the same rule is unnecessary. Śāstra operates when its trigger condition (nimitta) is present, irrespective of immediate external need, as explained in parjanya-valakṣaṇa-pravṛtti —like rain falls when conditions are met, not based on external necessity. The Mahābhāṣya accommodates both perspectives, leading to nuanced interpretations. In Paninian tradition, the agnivat example resolves the potential infinite regress: once the effect is achieved, the śāstra automatically ceases to operate. In the Haimavyākaraṇa tradition, Hemahansagaṇi treats this paribhāṣā as an explicit process-terminating principle, necessary for the smooth derivation of forms without looping operations. In contrast, later commentators like Vijayalavaṇyasūri, influenced by the Paninian reasoning in the Mahābhāṣya, downplay its independence and merge its function into broader paribhāṣās dealing with bādhakatva and nimitta. Thus, we see a gradual shift: Hemahansagaṇi uses it as a practical derivational rule. Nandighoṣavijaya interprets it in the same applied sense, focusing on ensuring pariniṣṭhitatva. Vijayalavaṇyasūri historicizes it and explains it as not self-standing but implied by deeper doctrinal paribhāṣās in Paninian theory. Historically, the succeeding paribhāṣā “yasya tu vidher nimittam asti nāsau bādhyate” is complementary. It asserts that if there is a valid cause (nimitta) for the application of a rule, it cannot be considered overridden. In other words, if the rule has a legitimate ground of application which produces a meaningful grammatical effect, it remains in force. Together, these paribhāṣās define a logic of relevance in rule application: A rule becomes overridden when its application is purposeless. But if there is a valid trigger (nimitta) producing a meaningful grammatical consequence, the rule must apply.",
      "observation": "What is particularly interesting in this paribhāṣā is the logical tension between śāstra-pravṛtti (rule activation) and śāstra-nivṛtti (rule termination). The necessity of such a paribhāṣā becomes evident when we observe derivational chains like: skṛ → sañcaskāra Here, if sasṭ and its lopa kept reapplying, we would get an infinite loop of additions and deletions, which is absurd. Thus, anarthaka upadeśa stops further redundant applications. Similarly, in uṇādi words like tad, additional affixation would be circular, as the form is already present in the lexicon. The paribhāṣā prevents such recursive redundancy. However, Vijayalavaṇyasūri challenges the status of “purposelessness. He argues that no śāstra is ever purposeless, because even when a form is unchanged, the rule’s inclusion maintains the logical sequence of derivation. What looks like purposelessness is only apparent; its true purpose lies in maintaining the order of rule precedence. Therefore, he sees these paribhāṣās (38–39) as instructive aids rather than fundamental principles of grammar. This reveals two differing schools of thought: Operational view (Hemahansagaṇi, Nandighoṣavijaya): treats the paribhāṣā as functionally necessary to terminate redundant derivation while Vijayalavaṇyasūri sees it as subsumed under higher-order paribhāṣās and Paninian paribhāṣā like yena nāprāpte yo vidhir ārabhyate sa tasyaiva bādhakaḥ.",
      "conclusion": "The paribhāṣā “yaṁ vidhiṁ pratyupadeśo’narthakaḥ sa vidhir bādhyate” plays an important role in preventing meaningless operations in the derivational process. It ensures that once a valid form is derived, no further redundant grammatical steps are taken, thereby safeguarding the principle of pariniṣṭhitatva (final stability of the word form). The succeeding nyāya “yasya tu vidher nimittam asti nāsau bādhyate” qualifies this by ensuring that any rule with a valid cause (nimitta) must still apply. However, Paninian reasoning (as highlighted by Vijayalavaṇyasūri) shows that these paribhāṣās are not independent absolutes. They function only in the broader framework of bādhakatva-logic, particularly the paribhāṣā yena nāprāpte yo vidhir ārabhyate sa tasyaiva bādhakaḥ. The Mahābhāṣya’s doctrine that śāstra is like fire (agnivat) shows that even apparent purposelessness has an underlying reason in maintaining derivational coherence. Generally, the exception rule negate the entire utsarga rule, but this nyāya limits its scope.",
      "Meaning and Application": "The paribhāṣā states that a rule (vidhi) whose application yields no meaningful effect or purpose (anartha) is considered overridden (bādhyate). The term upadeśaḥ here implies the act of prescribing or causing grammatical operation to take place. Thus, in simple terms, if the application of a rule in a certain context has no practical result, that rule is rendered non-operative in that context. The illustration given is from the uṇādi-pratyaya domain. The words tad, tyad, yad are already formed and stable as meaningful words through the uṇādi affix ḍad (as per tanityajiyajibhyo ḍad in the uṇādi-sūtra 895). If one were to apply another affix ḍa again as per ḍhuṭas tṛtīyaḥ (P. 2.1.76), it would lead to a redundant and purposeless operation (anartha), because the resultant forms would not differ from the already existing forms. Therefore, in such a context, the second application of ḍa is considered bādhyate, i.e., the rule is suspended since it serves no purpose. Another illustration is in the case of iterative operations like reduplication. For example, in forms like sañcaskāra (from the root skṛ), reduplication occurs. After reduplication, the grammatical process would normally require the sasṭ-prefix operation and its lopa (deletion) by aghoṣe śiṭaḥ (P. 4.1.45). However, after such an operation, reapplying the same sasṭ and its lopa again would yield no further distinct result—thus the repetition of the same rule would be meaningless. Therefore, the rule is considered overridden in that context. The succeeding paribhāṣā “yasya tu vidher nimittam asti nāsau bādhyate” is complementary. It asserts that if there is a valid cause (nimitta) for the application of a rule, it cannot be considered overridden. In other words, if the rule has a legitimate ground of application which produces a meaningful grammatical effect, it remains in force. Together, these paribhāṣās define a logic of relevance in rule application: A rule becomes overridden when its application is purposeless. But if there is a valid trigger (nimitta) producing a meaningful grammatical consequence, the rule must apply.

      "source": "The Nyāyasaṅgraha of Hemahansagaṇi provides the source in the derivational logic of taccāru. He explains the chain of rules: ḍhuṭas tṛtīyaḥ for dattva, then cajaḥ kagam for jathva, followed by aghoṣe prathamo’śiṭaḥ for chatva. Each later rule seems to erase the effect of the previous one, leading one to think the earlier steps were meaningless. But Hemahansagaṇi insists that skipping dattva would lead to an uncontrollable derivational cascade, proving that it serves as an essential preventive measure. Nandighoṣavijaya’s commentary reiterates the same. He explains that the dattva operation is needed to block the possibility of forming takcāru. It may appear that the dattva gets nullified, but its temporary presence is crucial because it restrains subsequent rules from applying incorrectly. In his view, this shows that a rule must be judged not merely by its final survival but by its role in maintaining the logical derivational pathway. Vijayalāvaṇyasūrī in his commentary expands on it. He observes that, in reality, any saprayojana-vidhi inherently sustains itself because of its necessity. He suggests that this paribhāṣā was added historically only to prevent confusion with the preceding paribhāṣā. The earlier paribhāṣā cancels rules that are purposeless (anarthaka), while this one preserves rules that appear temporarily nullified but are still indirectly purposeful. Thus, this paribhāṣā functions as a counterbalance. It was never meant as a primary operational principle but as a clarification to distinguish intermediate rules with utility from redundant ones.",
      "historicity": "Historically, this paribhāṣā belongs to a transitional phase in the Haima grammatical tradition. Hemahansagaṇi retains it as part of an ordered sequence to ensure the derivation remains logically consistent. He treats it as a necessary complement to the previous paribhāṣā. Nandighoṣavijaya follows Hemahansagaṇi, emphasising that real language forms like taccāru are the jñāpaka, the evidence that validates this paribhāṣā. However, Vijayalāvaṇyasūrī shift toward critical evaluation. He suggests the paribhāṣā might not be essential on its own because purposeful rules will naturally operate without needing a formal defense. The paribhāṣā survives more as a teaching tool to avoid the overextension of the earlier anarthaka-vidhi cancellation. Other grammatical traditions, like Kāṭantra or Śākāṭāyana, in their texts do not preserve this as an independent paribhāṣā. They subsume its reasoning under more general rules like “lakṣye lakṣaṇaṃ sakṛdeva pravartate” once a rule applies in its domain, it doesn’t need repetition or further justification. Thus, the 39th paribhāṣā becomes historically redundant.",
      "observation": "This nyāya acknowledges that the derivation process is not merely about final outcomes but about a sequenced chain of intermediate states. A rule may look temporary or even asat later, but it is meaningful if it stabilises the process and prevents unwanted forms. This is the procedural nature of Sanskrit grammar: it values the entire derivational process, not just the final word form. It also highlights the hierarchical distinction between rules. The preceding paribhāṣā targets only those rules that have no utility at all, while this nyāya saves rules that have any meaningful purpose. Without this paribhāṣā, one might nullify both purposeless and purposeful rules, leading to confusion in derivations. Hence, it clarifies the balance between rule cancellation and rule preservation. The example of taccāru becomes a concrete demonstration of how grammar ensures correct forms not only by prescribing rules but also by preventing misapplication. Even if the intermediate dattva vanishes later, its preventive role justifies its initial application. Vijayalāvaṇyasūrī’s commentary is equally significant because it shows the evolving attitude toward paribhāṣās. He does not regard it as a necessary independent principle.",
      "conclusion": "The paribhāṣā explains the principle that a rule with a valid purpose cannot be dismissed, even if its visible effect is temporary. Through the derivation of taccāru, Hemahansagaṇi shows that intermediate operations like dattva have hidden but essential roles. Nandighoṣavijaya confirms this by explaining that skipping such steps would lead to derivational breakdowns and incorrect forms. Vijayalāvaṇyasūrī, however, views the paribhāṣā as a balancing tool meant only to protect purposeful rules from being confused with entirely purposeless ones as described in the preceding paribhāṣā. Historically, this paribhāṣā fades from later traditions, being absorbed into broader principles like “lakṣye lakṣaṇaṃ sakṛd eva pravartate.” Nonetheless, its presence in the Nyāyasaṅgraha reflects a tendency of Haima grammarians to not rely on more general principles and instead maintain each paribhāṣā separately.",
      "Meaning and Application": "This paribhāṣā states that if a rule has a clear nimitta, meaning a purpose, cause, or fruitful result, that rule cannot be overridden or cancelled by any subsequent derivational step. In simple terms, a grammatical rule that contributes meaningfully to the derivation process—whether by producing an intermediate form or by preventing an undesirable outcome—retains its validity and cannot be rendered void. Nimitta in this context is not just an abstract reason; it refers to an actual functional necessity that ensures the derivation process reaches the correct outcome. Hemahansagaṇi clarifies this by showing how some rules might appear non-essential because their result is temporary, yet they still have an indispensable role in shaping the derivation. He illustrates this through the example of taccāru derived from tad + cāru. Here, the rule ḍhuṭas tṛtīyaḥ (2.1.76) prescribes the dattva transformation of d in tad. One might mistakenly think this step is redundant because later rules like jathva and chatva eventually erase this intermediate form. However, if dattva were skipped altogether, the derivation would spiral into unwanted transformations, producing incorrect outputs like takcāru or tagcāru. Thus even a transient transformation such as dattva is necessary because it prevents future errors. The application logic becomes clearer when we follow the sequential chain of rules. First, ḍhuṭas tṛtīyaḥ applies to tad and changes d to ḍ, producing an intermediate state. Then, as the derivation proceeds, cajaḥ kagam (2.1.86) prescribes jathva (softening the consonant to jaṭ). Later, aghoṣe prathamo’śiṭaḥ (1.3.50) prescribes chatva (palatalization). Each subsequent rule overrides the previous one, rendering its immediate product void in the final form. But crucially, the initial dattva prevents the derivation from jumping prematurely to gatva or katva, which would otherwise yield faulty intermediate forms. Thus, even though dattva becomes asat in later stages, it still serves a necessary intermediate purpose, making it a saprayojana-vidhi that cannot be dismissed. Nandighoṣavijaya, in his Hindi commentary, explains this with clarity. He highlights that in the form taccāru, the dattva change may appear to be temporary and erased later, yet it safeguards the derivation process by restricting other unwanted consonantal changes. Without dattva, later rules would wrongly trigger gatva or katva substitutions, and the final form would never settle into taccāru as attested in the language. Thus, even an “intermediate” or “asat” transformation is a purposeful step because it stabilises the derivation. Vijayalāvaṇyasūrī notes that in principle, a saprayojana-vidhi operates naturally; it does not require explicit safeguarding because its utility ensures its necessity. However, this paribhāṣā was historically introduced as a clarification to avoid confusion with the preceding paribhāṣā (38th), which declares that a purposeless rule is void and must not operate. Without this balancing paribhāṣā, one might mistakenly cancel meaningful intermediate rules by assuming they were equally purposeless."

      "source": "In the Nyāyasaṅgraha of Hemahansagaṇi it is introduced with the example of vidvatkulam, vidvān, anaḍvān. Hemahansagaṇi shows that in these words rutva from the sutra so ruḥ and ḍhatva from the sutra ho dhutpadānte are definitely applicable, so they are cancelled by datva from sraṃsdhvaṃskvassanaḍuho daḥ. But saṃyogānta-lopa from padasya applies only when a cluster appears due to n-āgama, which does not happen in vidvatkulam, so it is only partially applicable. Hence it is not cancelled. Thus datva cancels only what is unavoidable but does not affect what is conditional. The Hindi commentary of Nandighoṣavijaya repeats this. He says the rule that surely applies is cancelled, but the rule that applies sometimes and not other times is not cancelled. He too uses the vidvatkulam example and shows that rutva and ḍhatva are cancelled but saṃyogānta-lopa remains. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri, expands the logic. He says that this paribhāṣā is not an independent new theory but it explains what apavāda (exception) means. An apavāda cancels an utsarga (general rule) only in the exact overlapping domain. He compares this to the Kauṇḍinya example from Mahābhāṣya. He also explains that this is about the semantic scope of apavāda, that a specific rule overrides a general rule only in the same shared purpose, not beyond. Nāgeśa Bhaṭṭa in Paribhāṣenduśekhara says the same. He writes that an apavāda is a later rule that cancels a prior general rule, but only in the part where the prior rule is fully applicable. He connects it to the hierarchy of antaraṅga and bahiraṅga rules and other balābalokti-nyāyas. Vyādi in his Paribhāṣāsūcana gives a different jñāpaka using sani-forms. In forms like sani-ivantrdha, the specific svara-tisūti rule cancels the already definite ārddhadhātuka-it rule but does not affect those rules which are only conditionally applicable. In the Mahābhāṣya, this logic is expressed with the takra-Kauṇḍinya example to show how in real life too a later specific instruction cancels only the definite earlier instruction, not everything else. So the source material from all these texts agrees: this paribhāṣā explains the exact domain where a later rule overrides an earlier one.",
      "historicity": "This principle comes from the logical thinking of the Mahābhāṣya. The Bhāṣyakāra used everyday reasoning to explain how grammar works. The example of “Give curd to all Brāhmaṇas, but buttermilk only to Kauṇḍinya ” shows that even in ordinary commands, a later specific command cancels only part of the earlier command, not the entire command. This way of reasoning was then applied to grammar. Other than vyāḍi no early pāṇinian paribhāṣā author, like puruṣottama and sīradeva ,gives this nyāya place in their text. Over time, grammarians like Hemahansagaṇi codified this as a separate paribhāṣā to make it easier for students to understand when one rule cancels another. Nāgeśa Bhaṭṭa in the 17th century, systematised this further in the Paribhāṣenduśekhara. He made it part of the larger framework of apavāda vs utsarga and combined it with other balābalokti rules to show a consistent pattern. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri later took Nāgeśa’s ideas and clarified them even more by analysing the semantics of rule domains. So historically, this paribhāṣā is a refinement of ideas that were discussed implicitly in the Mahābhāṣya. It was developed into a clear rule in the later period to deal with the increasing need for systematic explanations of rule conflict.",
      "observation": "It shows that both Haima and Pāṇini systems are highly economical. Not all later rules cancel all earlier rules. Only those earlier rules that are definitely and unavoidably applicable are cancelled. This prevents unnecessary over-cancellation and keeps the system precise. Second, it shows that rule conflicts are domain-specific. The later rule only cancels the earlier rule in the shared domain. For example, datva cancels rutva and ḍhatva because they overlap completely in vidvatkulam, but it does not cancel saṃyogānta-lopa because that rule does not operate there. It uses worldly analogies to make abstract grammar clear. The Kauṇḍinya example in Mahābhāṣya is easy to understand, and it helps us see that grammar is built on the same reasoning as the common world. This paribhāṣā works together with other rules like antaraṅgādapyāpavādo balvāna and purastād apavādāḥ… to create a balanced hierarchy. All these paribhāṣās ensure that grammar produces the correct forms without endless looping. It connects to discussions of bādha-bīja, or seeds of cancellation. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri talks about different kinds of bādha-bīja, and this paribhāṣā helps to distinguish them more clearly.",
      "conclusion": "The paribhāṣā explains the concept of apavāda and how a later rule cancels an earlier one. It tells us that the later rule cancels an earlier rule only when the earlier one is definitely applicable and unavoidable. If the earlier rule is only partly applicable, it is not cancelled. This principle can be seen in examples like vidvatkulam and vidvān, where datva cancels only the definitely applicable rutva and ḍhatva but leaves the conditional saṃyogānta-lopa untouched. The Mahābhāṣya gives a simple everyday analogy, Hemahansagaṇi explains it with practical forms, Nāgeśa and Vijayalāvaṇyasūri analyze it as the meaning of apavāda, and Vyādi gives additional illustrations. So this paribhāṣā is not just another rule of priority; it is a definition of what a true exception is. It keeps the grammar logical and avoids unnecessary cancellation.",
      "Meaning and Application": "The paribhāṣā describes how one grammatical rule can cancel another in a very specific situation. It does not say that every later rule cancels all earlier rules. Instead, it explains that when a rule is started deliberately in a place where the result of an earlier rule is definitely and necessarily obtained, this new rule cancels that earlier one. If the earlier rule was certain and unavoidable, then the later rule acts as a bādhaka or overriding rule. But the paribhāṣā adds an important restriction. If the earlier rule is not definitely applicable, if it applies only sometimes and not always, this is called prāptyaprāptimān, then the later rule does not cancel it. In other words, the later rule cancels only a prior rule that produces a sure and inevitable result (avashya-prāpti), but it does not cancel a prior rule that is uncertain or conditional. This becomes clearer through the examples. In words like vidvatkulam, vidvān, he vidvan, the rule so ruḥ (2.1.72) substitutes r at the place of s. Similarly, in words like svanaḍutkulam, anaḍvān, he anaḍvan, the rule ho dhutpadānte (2.1.82) gives ḍhatva (turning h into ḍh). But there is also a rule called saṃyogānta-lopa from padasya (2.1.79) which deletes consonant clusters. This saṃyogānta-lopa does not always apply; it only applies when n-āgama creates a consonant cluster. In words like vidvatkulam and svanaḍutkulam there is no ghuṭ (augment) and so no cluster, so the lopa never applies. Now there is another rule sraṃsdhvaṃskvassanaḍuho daḥ (2.1.68) which imposes datva (turning n into d). When this rule is applied, it cancels rutva and ḍhatva because those are definitely present in those words. But it does not cancel saṃyogānta-lopa, because in those cases the lopa is not definitely present. Therefore in vidvatkulam and svanaḍutkulam, rutva and ḍhatva are suppressed and datva appears. But in vidvān, he vidvan, anaḍvān, he anaḍvan, the saṃyogānta-lopa still survives because it is not a universally applicable rule in those contexts. This is exactly the kind of situation the paribhāṣā explains. The latter rule cancels only what is definitely obtained, not what is partly applicable. The Mahābhāṣya compares this to a worldly example: someone says, “Give curd to all Brāhmaṇas, but give only buttermilk to Kauṇḍinya.” In this case the later instruction cancels the earlier one only for Kauṇḍinya, but for other Brāhmaṇas the earlier general order remains. In the same way, in grammar the later specific rule cancels the earlier general rule only in the overlapping domain where it applies. So the paribhāṣā is about a limited and cancellation, not a blanket priority. It tells us when and how a new rule takes away the effect of an older one."

    "text": {
      "source": "The jñāpaka of this nyāya provided by Hemahansagani is negation of the word kalihali for augmentation in the sūtra nāminokalihaleḥ 4/3/51, because after ṇic affix is added to the word kalihali, there is simultaneous applicability of tryantyasvarādeḥ 7/4/43 and 4/3/51. In this context, sūtra 7/4/43 being nitya and later occurring, by this nyāya, the omission of the final vowel letter would occur first. However, in words like patu and laghu, the omission of the final letter occurs only after augmentation. To address this, the word kalihali is negated in the sūtra 4/3/51, so that in words like patu and laghu, the elision of the final vowel letter occurs only after augmentation. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri rejects this jñāpaka given by Hemahansagani. He argues that paratva (prior application in rule-order or derivation) can fully account for the precedence of luk over vṛddhi in kali-hali words. If a sufficient upāya (explanatory principle) like paratva exists to explain the derivational ordering, there is no need to invoke a separate paribhāṣā like balavannityam anityāt or derive it from kalihali-exclusion. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri asserts that the primary reason for excluding kali-hali is to ensure that vṛddhi applies first, not to confirm the strength of luk. If the luk were universally stronger (i.e., always to be applied first because it is nitya), no such exclusion would be necessary. Thus, the exclusion is evidence of vṛddhi’s strength, not of luk’s. Nandighoṣavijaya justifies Hemahaṃsagaṇi’s position by addressing a potential objection that the strength of antyasvarādi-lopa may derive not from its nityatva alone but also from its paratva (later occurrence). He also anticipates an objection that perhaps antyasvarādi-lopa is not strong just because it is nitya, but because it is also para (comes later). To this, he gives a reasoning that nityatva is the primary quality, and even if paratva contributes, the jñāpaka refers only to nityatva because: “pradhāna-dharmaḥ sambhavati cet apradhānasya vyapadeśo na kriyate” If the principal attribute is possible, then the subordinate one is not mentioned.",
      "historicity": "This nyāya is listed with slightly different wording, nityānityayor nityaḥ vidhiḥ balavān for the first time in the Vyāḍi Paribhāṣāpāṭha edited by Abhyankar. However, no commentary by Vyāḍi on this nyāya is available. It also appears in the Sākatāyana Paribhāṣā text with the same wording as in Vyāḍi’s version, and similarly lacks commentary. The first known commentator on this nyāya is Bhāvamiśra of the Kātantra grammatical tradition. In his explanation, he states: kṛtākṛta-prasaṅgī yaḥ vidhiḥ sa nityaḥ, meaning, a rule that applies whether another operation is performed or not, is to be treated as nitya. This nyāya does not appear in many later paribhāṣā texts. Although in the Vyāḍi Paribhāṣāpāṭha, it is listed immediately after the nyāya kṛtākṛta-prasaṅgī yaḥ vidhiḥ sa nityaḥ, the fact that Vyāḍi neither lists nor comments on it in his Paribhāṣāsūcana makes it doubtful whether he intended to retain it in the Paribhāṣāpāṭha. Nāgeśa too does not give this nyāya an independent place in his text. Instead, he incorporates its idea within the nyāya kvacit kṛtākṛta-prasaṅgamātreṇa api nityatā. In some cases, even the mere possibility of occurrence in both the done and not-done contexts (kṛta-akṛta-prasaṅga-mātra) is sufficient for nityatva to be assumed. That is, if the second operation is done, and even then the first (supposedly nitya) operation has the mere potential (prasaṅga-mātra) to apply, then that alone is sufficient to designate it as nitya; there need not be an actual bādhaka–abādhita–phalopahita relation (resultant effect qualified by an override relationship). Vijayalāvaṇyasūri cites Kaiyaṭa’s worldly analogy (laukika dṛṣṭānta) to explain the principle that something constantly operative (nitya) is considered stronger than something which is not (anitya), when both are available simultaneously “When Vāli and Sugrīva are fighting, and Vāli is killed by Bhagavān (Rāma) himself, the world does not attribute superiority (prādhānya) to Sugrīva. But when the Pāṇḍavas, even with the help of Bhagavān (Kṛṣṇa), defeat the Kauravas, the world does speak of the superiority of the Pāṇḍavas. In Sugrīva’s case, the actual execution (killing of Vāli) is entirely done by Rāma. Sugrīva’s contribution is marginal. Hence, despite being victorious, he does not receive full credit. In the Pāṇḍavas’ case, though Kṛṣṇa provides guidance and support, the actual execution is carried out by the Pāṇḍavas themselves, such as Arjuna fighting in battle. Hence, credit is attributed to them, and their superiority is accepted. In grammatical terms: If an operation is only possible due to the intervention of something else (like Sugrīva’s victory due to Rāma), then that operation is not truly “nitya” and cannot be considered strong (balavat). But if the operation can occur regardless of whether another operation is done or not (like the Pāṇḍavas’ capacity to fight), then it has independent status (nityatva), and wins in case of conflict. Hence, nityatva becomes the cause of bādhakatva (overriding power), just like in worldly usage, credit is given only to the independently effective contributor.",
      "observation": "From Hemahaṃsagaṇi’s perspective, the rule “balavannityam anityāt” operates procedurally: the nitya operation takes effect first and blocks the anitya operation. In the example of akārṣṭa, the vṛddhi rule applies first because it is nitya, which prevents the application of the sic-luk rule, which is anitya. This sequence is supported by the presence of a jñāpaka in the form of the exclusion of the word kalihali in the sūtra nāmino’kalihaleḥ (4.3.51). Hemahaṃsagaṇi sees this exclusion as evidence that vṛddhi must occur before the luk, even though the luk is also technically nitya. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri disagrees with this view. He states that the exclusion of kalihali is not meant to show that luk is weaker than vṛddhi, but rather to ensure that vṛddhi is not blocked by luk. He argues that the derivational sequence can be explained using paratva (order of rule application), and if that is sufficient, there is no need to invoke nityatva to justify the order. According to him, if nityatva were truly the reason, then no exclusion would be needed at all. Therefore, he concludes that the exclusion clause is a support for the precedence of vṛddhi, not a sign of the weakness of luk. He supports this with the principle: “If the primary reason is available, the secondary reason is not separately mentioned.” This is also quoted in Paribhāṣenduśekhara. Nāgeśa, in his explanation, allows for nityatva to be established even when the rule does not get applied in the final output, as long as it has the possibility (prasaṅga) of being applied in both the done (kṛta) and not-done (akṛta) cases. However, he also clarifies that such possibility-based nityatva is not accepted in every situation. For example, if a rule only applies through the mediation of another word-element (śabdāntara) or depends on an external factor, it is not nitya, even if it appears universally available. He therefore places limits on how far kṛtākṛta-prasaṅga can justify nityatva. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri accepts Nāgeśa’s distinction, but adds that even a rule with independent nityatva does not automatically become balavat (stronger) in every case. He says the application must be evaluated based on lakṣya-anurodha, meaning the overall goal of derivation. To illustrate this, he quotes a worldly analogy from Kaiyaṭa: if Rāma kills Vāli while Sugrīva is only present, Sugrīva is not considered victorious. But if the Pāṇḍavas, even with the help of Bhagavān (Kṛṣṇa), defeat the Kauravas, the world does speak of the superiority of the Pāṇḍavas. In grammatical terms: If an operation is only possible due to the intervention of something else (like Sugrīva’s victory due to Rāma), then that operation is not truly “nitya” and cannot be considered strong (balavat). But if the operation can occur regardless of whether another operation is done or not (like the Pāṇḍavas’ capacity to fight), then it has independent status (nityatva), and wins in case of conflict. Hence, nityatva is not a guarantee of bādhakatva, but only one possible basis for it, which must be tested in context. Patanjali also explains the same in his commentary of sutra P 7.4.1.",
      "conclusion": "This paribhāṣā explains how conflicts between rules are to be resolved when both apply simultaneously: the nitya rule is preferred over the anitya rule. Hemahaṃsagaṇi explains this principle through procedural examples, using the exclusion of kalihali as evidence that vṛddhi, being nitya, applies before luk. Nandighoṣavijaya supports this by saying that nityatva is the primary cause of strength, and if present, other causes like paratva are not separately invoked. However, Vijayalāvaṇyasūri does not accept this explanation. He argues that when paratva (prior order) is enough to explain the derivational sequence, there is no need to use this paribhāṣā. He views the exclusion of kalihali not as a sign of the weakness of luk, but as a rule to preserve the order of vṛddhi first. He also emphasises that even if a rule is nitya, it may not always be balavat unless it fulfils the function independently, in line with the derivational target. He uses a worldly analogy to show that just as credit is given only to the one who acts independently, grammatical priority also depends on actual contribution, not just presence. The paribhāṣā “balavannityam anityāt” thus serves as a useful principle for identifying stronger rules in conflict situations, but its application depends on context. While nityatva often implies strength, it does not override other explanatory factors like derivational order (paratva) or rule-goal alignment (lakṣya-anurodha). The strength of a rule must be determined by its independent role in the derivation, not just by its categorisation as nitya or anitya.",
      "Meaning and Application": "The meaning of this paribhāṣā is nitya operations are deemed stronger than anitya operations. Hemahansagani defines nitya operation as an operation that still applies even after another operation is performed, and also applies before that other operation (always applicable). The operation that applies before another operation but ceases to apply after that other operation is called anitya (conditional). When both nitya and anitya operations become applicable at the same time, the nitya operation is considered stronger than the anitya one. This is formulated as a principle for resolving rule conflict. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri, in his Taranga commentary, provides an extensive explanation of this sūtra, linking it with previously discussed paribhāṣā related to rule-conflict. He introduces the paribhāṣā in the context of discussing the presence or absence of bādhakabīja (causal seed of overriding). He connects it to the earlier rule \"na prāpte.. 40 \": bāndhakatvabījakathana-prasaṃgena anavakāśatvasya sakala-bādhakabīja-prādhānyena tan-nirūpanaṃ ādau kṛtaṃ yena 'na prāpte' iti nyāyena, samprati nityatvam api kvacid bādhakatva-bījam iti varṇayituṃ nyāyo’yam āśritaḥ. He explains that just as the absence of scope (anavakāśatva) can function as a cause to negate a rule's application, so too can nityatva (the quality of being regularly applicable) serve as a basis for giving a rule overriding status. Thus, nitya is not just a descriptive term for a rule's applicability but can also functionally act as a factor that determines the outcome in rule conflict."

    "text": {
      "source": "This nyāya is specified through the composition of the sūtra vṛttyanto'saṣe H 1.1.2, specifically in the usage of the term antar. Upon the replacement of the letter r with u, two concurrent operations transpire: firstly, the substitution of v, and secondly, the substitution of o. However, it is important to note that the former operation is invalidated by this nyāya, as it necessitates two words to execute and pertains to a bahiraṅga operation. Conversely, the latter operation remains viable as it solely relies on the usage of a single word, thus qualifying it as an antaraṅga operation. Nandighoṣavijaya, commenting on this, reinforces that in the example vṛkṣa i indram, the internal rule operates within the boundary of a single pada, while the external rule acts between padas. Since one-pada rules are more immediate, they take precedence. He connects this logically with the internal meaning of the word antaranga, showing its stronger operational position. The Mahābhāṣya source is the bhāṣya on vipratiṣedhe paraṁ kāryam (Aṣṭādhyāyī 1.4.2), where the example dyaukāmiḥ is used. There, Patañjali shows that when two transformations apply, one operating within a word and another across words, the internal rule must apply first. Śīradeva, in his Bṛhatparibhāṣāvṛtti (on 22nd paribhāṣā), gives this rule and limits its application. He points out that this paribhāṣā does not override the asiddha rule (asiddhaṁ bahiraṅgam antarange) in domains where the paribhāṣā nañānantarasya bahiraṅgaprakalptiḥ blocks it. So there are domains where this rule cannot be applied. Haribhāskara in Paribhāṣābhāskara expands on this and discusses that in syonaḥ, an internal operation like guṇa is stronger than an external one like yāṇ transformation. He also notes that the Mahābhāṣya example of dyaukāmiḥ is questioned, and alternative examples are given to better illustrate the paribhāṣā. Puruṣottama mentions that even in cases where the “asiddhatva” paribhāṣā blocks the external rule, the present paribhāṣā continues to function because of its priority in logic. He also stresses that this rule was revived and emphasised by Patañjali himself with the phrase anayā eva siddham in the vipratiṣedha sūtra.",
      "historicity": "The Mahābhāṣya is the earliest known text to explicitly use this principle, especially in its discussion of vipratiṣedha. Patañjali does not mention the nyāya directly in that passage, but the idea is made explicit when he chooses one rule over another due to its internal position. Puruṣottama, in his commentary, directly attributes the origin of this paribhāṣā to Patañjali and refers to the vipratiṣedha bhāṣya as its locus. He states that the phrase anayā eva siddham used in the Mahābhāṣya confirms the application of this rule independently of asiddhatva. He refers to this rule as active even in the presence of the asiddha principle. He asserts that even when an asiddha block exists, the antarāṅga-bahiraṅga relation still allows internal rules to apply. He interprets savarna dīrgha as bahiraṅga and blocked, while it-rule (like guṇa or yaṇ) is antarāṅga and operational. In contrast, Śīradeva treats this paribhāṣā as part of the larger debate between the asiddha paribhāṣā and antaranga. He recognises that in some domains, such as nañānantarasya, this rule does not apply because asiddha explicitly blocks the bahiraṅga operation. Yet, he defends its general validity and necessity in contexts where no blocking clause exists. He also connects it to cases like vṛkṣa i iha → vṛkṣeha, where guṇa must apply before savarna dīrgha. He rejects claims that the paribhāṣā is blocked by na ājānāntarye, arguing that this applies only to bahiraṅga paribhāṣā, not antarāṅga ones. Haribhāskara points out that Patañjali’s examples may not always be sufficient to demonstrate the paribhāṣā clearly. He argues that later examples, like vṛkṣe indraḥ, are better suited. He supports Kaiyaṭa’s view that when yaṇ or guṇa are present through a more direct context, they block savarna dīrgha. He also responds to the view that this paribhāṣā is already implied in asiddhaṁ bahiraṅgam antarange by showing that they function differently; one talks about blocking, while the other discusses the order of application. He says the Bhāṣyakāra, in the vipratiṣedha-sūtra (1.4.2), explains the antarāṅga paribhāṣā with a specific purpose and, by the phrase anayā eva siddham (“by this alone it is accomplished”), shows that this rule is not derived from the earlier asiddha paribhāṣā. He does not interpret it as redundant. Nor can it be claimed that in ayaja indram etc., based on the Bhāṣya’s view, due to the denial of bahiraṅga paribhāṣā by nājānantare, savarna-dīrgha would result. Why? Because the viewpoint adopted is that of pada-saṁskāra (word-based derivation). If instead, the theory of vākya-saṁskāra (sentence-based derivation) were accepted and this paribhāṣā were applied, then due to śabda-para-vipratiṣedha (rule conflict based on sound-form), a contradiction or irregularity would occur. Nandighoṣavijaya clarifies that antarāṅga applies not only due to proximity but also due to the order of dependency. A rule that operates earlier in derivation must be treated as antarāṅga. He uses examples from Haima sūtras and shows that if the outer rule blocks the inner one, it disturbs the sequence of derivation.",
      "observation": "This paribhāṣā has been accepted across almost all major grammatical traditions. In the Haima system, Hemahansagaṇi explains its practical role in sentence formation by focusing on pāda-based operations. He shows that antaranga rules (those acting on one word) are applied before bahiraṅga rules (those requiring two words), especially when both are simultaneously applicable. Nandighoṣavijaya supports Hemahansa’s explanation and refers to the sūtra vṛttyanto’saṣe to show that antaranga operations are inherently stronger, even when both antaranga and bahiraṅga rules are simultaneously active. He also stresses that antaranga rules are nearer and more fundamental and must be completed before considering more external operations. Puruṣottama supports the view that this paribhāṣā is not overridden even when the asiddha paribhāṣā applies. He gives examples like vṛkṣe indraḥ, where even though a bahiraṅga operation like savarṇadīrgha is available, the internal operation like i > e by guṇa is applied first. Śīradeva discusses possible exceptions and shows that antaranga paribhāṣā does not override sūtra-specific exceptions like nañānantarasya. He maintains that the paribhāṣā is valid but restricted in cases where other paribhāṣās are specifically declared. Haribhāskara raises doubts about the examples cited by Patañjali in the Mahābhāṣya and points out that better support for this rule comes from examples used in Kāśikā or later literature. He also supports the padasaṁskāra viewpoint, which considers individual word formation before sentence integration. A major debate across traditions involves the scope of this rule when asiddha status is given to the bahiraṅga rule. According to some grammarians, asiddhaṁ bahiraṅgam antarange itself makes this rule redundant. But commentators like Puruṣottama argue that even in such situations, antarangaṁ bahiraṅgāt still helps establish precedence by logical structure. Vijayalāvaṇyasuri states that just as declaring that Devadatta is stronger than Yajñadatta becomes redundant when we assert that Yajñadatta is weak in relation to Devadatta, the same principle applies to the antaraṅga and bahiraṅga scenario and therefore this nyāya holds no necessity, for the previously mentioned nyāya, asiddhaṃ bahiraṅgamantaraṅge N 1.20, already elucidates the inherent frailty of the bahiraṅga operation in comparison to the antaraṅga operation. Another key debate is whether this rule is meant for word formation (padasaṁskāra) or sentence structure (vākya-saṁskāra). According to the padasaṁskārapakṣa paradigm, emphasis is placed on the independent construction of each word, which are then connected to establish a coherent and meaningful sentence. On the other hand, the vākyasaṃkārapakṣa perspective presents the complete sentence as a whole to the intellect, after which the individual constituent words are methodically crafted to align with the intended meaning and structure. In the padasaṁskāra view, antaranga operations happen in isolation, so this rule is relevant. But in the vākya-saṁskāra view, external context determines rule application, so antaranga precedence becomes less clear.",
      "conclusion": "The paribhāṣā antarāṅgaṁ bahiraṅgāt serves as a fundamental control for rule application. It defines a structural priority among rules, not based on strength of outcome, but based on proximity to the derivational core. A rule that acts within the limits of a single word or root must apply before a rule that acts across boundaries or combines elements. Across all traditions, Haima, Pāṇinian, Kātantra this rule holds the same function. Commentators differ on its scope, its interaction with asiddhatva, and whether it needs independent statement. But they all accept that antarāṅga rules must precede bahiraṅga ones when both are simultaneously available. In the Haima system, Hemahaṃsagaṇi applies this to sound changes that occur within a pada before allowing any external sandhi to take place. Nandighoṣavijaya and Vijayalāvaṇyasūri reinforce this with structure-first arguments. Śīradeva defends its validity even when asiddha conditions block bahiraṅga rules. Haribhāskara limits its application to situations where rule competition is not already blocked by another principle. The paribhāṣā plays a central role in keeping rule application layered and predictable. Without this, outer-level rules could wrongly override internal ones, breaking the logic of word formation. In grammar, the internal transformation (like guṇa or yaṇ) blocks the outer (like savarna dīrgha) from activating until it completes. Hemacandra’s tendency to follow the previous grammarians and incorporating the paribhāṣās of Bhoja as it is, who in turn follows Śākatāyana, albeit with a different wording, seems to be the reason for accepting this nyāya as a separate nyāya in the Haima grammatical system.",
      "Meaning and Application": "This paribhāṣā lays down a principle for conflict resolution between two types of rules: antarāṅga and bahiraṅga. The explanation is the same as the previous nyāya. Where there both antaraṅga and bahiraṅga operations are applicable, which one should be applied? This nyāya states that in that case, first, the antaraṅga operation is to be done, later if conditions are satisfied then the bahiraṅga is to be done. For example,in ta indraṃ and vṛkṣa indram the primary formation is tad jas indraṃ and vṛkṣa ṅi indraṃ. After the substitution of i at the place of jas by the rule “jas iḥ H 1.4.7” in tad jas indraṃ and since ṅ of ṅi is a mute letter (it) in vṛkṣa ṅi indraṃ, it is elided, now it becomes ta i indraṃ and vṛkṣa i indraṃ. In this situation, both the rules H 1.2.1 and H 1.2.6 are simultaneously applicable. When the vowel i is conjugated with the i of the word indraṃ, it is replaced with the long vowel e as per the rule “Samānānāṃ tena dĩrghaḥ H 1.2.1”. Similarly, when i is conjugated with a in ta and vṛkṣa, it is replaced with the vowel e as per the rule “avarṇasyevarṇādinai H 1.2.6”. Although both operations are obtained simultaneously, the substitution of e is an antaraṅga operation because it is dependent on one pāda word, whereas the lengthening of e is dependent on both pādas and is a bahiraṅga operation. Therefore, negating the lengthening of e, the antaraṅga operation, i.e., the substitution of e at the place of a and e by the rule “avarṇasyevarṇādinai H 1.2.6” takes precedence."

      "source": "Hemahaṃsagaṇi derives the presence of this paribhāṣā from the prāpti-avakāśa logic seen in the structuring of sūtras themselves. He argues that if the more specific rule bhis ais were not intended to apply in places like vṛkṣaiḥ, then there would be no need to formulate it separately. The fact that it was formulated, despite the existence of the more general rule, suggests an intention to prioritize the narrower rule. Therefore, he presents (H 1.4.2) itself as the jñāpaka the of this paribhāṣā. Without the presence of this nyāya, this sūtra would become redundant. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri builds on this, stating that this paribhāṣā is essentially an elaboration of the earlier paribhāṣā yena nāprāpte yo vidhir ārabhyate sa tasya bādhakaḥ. According to him, both paribhāṣās concern rule conflict, but they differ subtly. In niravakāśaṁ sāvkāśāt, the rule conflict arises from differences in the scope or domain of applicability, while in “yena nāprāpte…”, the conflict hinges on the temporal sequence of applicability. Still, in both cases, the rule that applies in a more exclusive or primary domain ends up blocking the other. Nandighoṣavijaya, following Hemahaṃsagaṇi’s reasoning, also cites “bhis ais” as the direct jñāpaka, noting that this rule would serve no purpose if “ed bahus bhosi” were to override it in all cases. He adds that the creation of bhis ais must have been guided by this nyāya, which prescribes the superiority of the narrower rule.",
      "historicity": "This paribhāṣā appears in the Vyāḍi and Cāndra Paribhāṣāpāṭha and commentated for the first time in Haima tradition by Hemahaṃsagaṇi. Later elaborated upon by both Nandighoṣavijaya and Vijayalāvaṇyasūri. However, its underlying logic can be found in earlier Pāṇinian commentaries, especially in the Mahābhāṣya. In the Mahābhāṣya and in Nāgeśa’s Paribhāṣenduśekhara, the phrase “yena nāprāpte yo vidhir ārabhyate sa tasya bādhakaḥ” is given as a general principle for resolving rule conflict. This principle covers both the scope-based conflict (as seen in niravakāśaṁ sāvkāśāt) and the order-based conflict. Nāgeśa does not separate the two into distinct paribhāṣās. Instead, he considers niravakāśa as a particular extension of the more fundamental yena nāprāpte nyāya. He discusses examples like the ṣaṣṭhī-taddhita derivations and verbal suffix interactions where, even when a broader rule is still possible, the narrower or newly introduced one blocks it if it fits a tighter context. He emphasises that the bādhakatva (capacity to override) is determined not only by impossibility (asambhava) but also by contextual narrowness and purpose-fulfillment (acāritārthya). The Haima tradition, however, separates this as an independent paribhāṣā, suggesting that Hemahaṃsagaṇi and his followers felt that the notion of scope-based rule strength required a distinct articulation. This is also evident in how Vijayalāvaṇyasūri insists on distinguishing between the two paribhāṣās despite their common lineage.",
      "observation": "Across the various grammatical traditions—Haima, Pāṇinian, and their commentators, this paribhāṣā reflects a shared concern about rule conflict where the specificity of application becomes decisive. The main difference lies in how explicitly this concern is addressed. In the Haima tradition, Hemahaṃsagaṇi treats the paribhāṣā as independent. He establishes its operational relevance using the structure of sūtras themselves. His logic is procedural: if a more narrowly applicable rule (like “bhis ais”) exists, then it must override the more broadly applicable one (“ed bahus bhosi”) in contexts where both could apply. He argues that, otherwise, the more specific rule would become meaningless, and its sūtra would be rendered useless. This makes the strength of a rule a function of its exclusive scope, not just its derivational priority or impossibility of coexistence. Nandighoṣavijaya supports this line of thought. He defines niravakāśa as having fewer targets and sāvkāśa as having more. He agrees that the rule with fewer applicable contexts wins because it leaves no space (avakāśa) for the broader rule to act. He says this is not just a theoretical priority; it leads to sūtra construction. Without this principle, “bhis ais” would never have been composed, because it would never get to apply. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri, though agreeing in spirit, introduces a comparative subtlety. He identifies this paribhāṣā as an extension of “yena nāprāpte…”, but not a duplication. His reasoning comes from observing that some bādhaka rules act in impossible overlap situations (asambhava), while others act even when both rules are simultaneously possible. In his view, niravakāśaṁ sāvkāśāt accounts for this latter case. He uses familiar examples like sarve brāhmaṇāḥ bhojyantām vs. tākram kauṇḍinyāya to explain how narrower, goal-specific instructions override general ones, even when both can technically apply. Thus, he classifies niravakāśaṁ sākāśāt as a distinct logical branch, important for revealing the variety of blocking mechanisms in grammar. Nāgeśa, on the other hand, prefers not to split this into a separate paribhāṣā. He considers the underlying reasoning, the impossibility of simultaneous operation and the inference of purposelessness (acāritārthya) as already covered under the “yena nāprāpte…” paribhāṣā. He critiques the notion that simply being narrower should automatically grant overriding power. For him, it is not just about the number of domains but whether a rule is being invalidated because the target has already been modified or no longer exists as an eligible candidate. In places like “āyādaḥ” (3.1.31), where a more specific affix like “śap” is overtaken by “āya”. Nāgeśa treats niravakāśatva not as a cause for blocking, but as a symptom or result of blocking that has already happened due to cāritārthya. Therefore, he does not see the need to define as an independent paribhāṣā. Thus, while all scholars agree that some rules override others due to specificity, they differ in how they label, justify, and structure this principle. Haima commentators insist on identifying it separately, even using it as a structural tool for explaining sūtra formulation. Nāgeśa, while acknowledging the logic, considers it a subset of broader rule-blocking mechanisms, already housed in other, older paribhāṣās.",
      "conclusion": "The paribhāṣā “niravakāśaṁ sākāśāt” expresses a rule of grammatical logic that has implications not only for derivational accuracy but also for the structure of grammatical texts. The principle states that a more narrowly scoped rule overrides a more broadly applicable one, and this idea is anchored in examples like the preference of bhis ais over ed bahus bhosi. Hemahaṃsagaṇi and Nandighoṣavijaya present this as a necessary metarule, without which several sūtras would lose their relevance. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri supports this but embeds it within a hierarchical classification of rule conflicts. He believes it captures a nuance not handled by earlier rules cases where both rules are technically applicable, yet one must dominate due to scope. He retains the Haima separation but links it to the Pāṇinian paribhāṣā. Nāgeśa does not treat it separately. For him, scope alone cannot define strength. The real issue is functional redundancy and contextual failure of eligibility. He reads such cases through the lens of acāritārthya and anavakāśa as they appear in his discussions of affixation and sandhi. He sees this paribhāṣā not as wrong but as unnecessary to state independently. This paribhāṣā is affirmed in application by all major traditions, but its status as a separate principle remains debated. The Haima tradition uses it separately for rule prioritisation. The Pāṇinian tradition sees it as subsumed under more general principles of precedence, impossibility, and purpose-fulfilment. The disagreement is not about the outcome, which rule wins, but about the logical framing of why it wins.",
      "Meaning and Application": "The paribhāṣā “niravakāśaṁ sāvkāśāt” means: “A rule that applies in a more narrowly defined context (niravakāśa, ‘without room for anything else’) overrides a rule that applies in a broader context (sāvkāśa, ‘with room for others’).” In simpler terms, when two grammatical rules are applicable, the one that applies to a more specific situation (narrow scope) is stronger and will block the rule that applies more generally (broad scope). To illustrate this, Hemahaṃsagaṇi provides an example using the sutras: bhis ais (H 1.4.2). This rule applies specifically to the instrumental singular suffix bhis. ed bahus bhosi (H 1.4.4). This rule applies more generally, covering many plural suffixes like bhiḥ, bhyaḥ, ṣaṣṭhī-dvivacana oḥ, etc. In a case like vṛkṣaiḥ (with trees), both rules seem applicable. But since “bhis ais” applies only to one suffix and “ed bahus bhosi” applies to many, the former is more narrowly scoped and hence prevails. The specific rule bhis ais blocks the more general rule ed bahus bhosi, demonstrating the operation of this paribhāṣā."

      "source": "In the Haima tradition, Hemahaṃsagaṇi demonstrates its working with the examples of ūvatuḥ and ūvuḥ. He treats this as an exception to the antarāṅga–bahiraṅga rule. The jñāpaka (indicatory evidence) for this paribhāṣā, according to Hemahaṃsagaṇi, is the avoidance of ill-formed outputs such as ūvatūḥ. The very formulation of the rule dhātor i varṇaḥ (H 2.1.50) implies its precedence, which would be pointless if vowel lengthening always overrode it. Thus, the existence of this sūtra signals that prakṛti-based operations must sometimes take priority over vārṇa-based ones. Nandighoṣavijaya explains the same paribhāṣā in Hindi. He agrees with Hemahaṃsagaṇi that the prakṛti here should be understood as the dhātu, not the nāma. He emphasizes that a sound-based rule is one where the explicit articulation of a phoneme governs the operation, while a prakṛti-based rule is one where the operation is triggered by the utterance of the dhātu. The paribhāṣā thus allows dhātu-based rules to override vārṇa-based rules, reversing the order otherwise expected under the antarāṅga–bahiraṅga principle. He notes that Hemahaṃsagaṇi’s explanation is that no explicit attempt is made to prohibit such forms, but the very necessity of avoiding them indicates the existence of this paribhāṣā. Nandighoṣa, however, criticizes this as weak, preferring instead to ground the jñāpaka in the actual sūtras like pūrvasya asve svare yvoriyav (H 4.1.37), where simultaneous operations would create contradictions unless this paribhāṣā is applied. He also notes that this principle is anitya (non-permanent) because it becomes limited or overridden by the next paribhāṣā, yvṛd yvṛdāśrayaṃ ca (45). Vijayalāvaṇyasūri explains that the terms “vārṇa” and “prakṛti” in this context refer to operations conditioned by phoneme placement versus root-based conditioning[cite: 2518, 2519]. He highlights that this paribhāṣā applies only when both operations target the same element (sāmāna-kāryitva). The underlying logic is that the dhātu-based rule carries stronger authority due to its deeper structural joining. He also points out that in the Pāṇinian framework, prakṛti includes both nāma and dhātu, as seen in Mahābhāṣya references (e.g., under svarito vā’nudātte padādau P 8.2.6), where both dhātu and nāma are considered prakṛti. In the Haima system, Hemahaṃsagaṇi deliberately restricts it to dhātu-prakṛti. The Mahābhāṣya itself provides indirect support. In the commentary on P. 6.1.12 (dāśvān sāhvān mīḍhvāṃśca), Patañjali introduces discussions of reduplication, vowel lengthening, and samprasāraṇa. The need to insert exceptions and prohibitions indicates that prakṛti-based rules sometimes override vārṇa-based rules. This passage has been explained by later grammarians, including Nandighoṣavijaya and Haribhāskara, as the jñāpaka of this paribhāṣā. In the Pāṇinian tradition, scholars like Pūruṣottama, Śīradeva, Haribhāskara, and Nāgeśa also comment extensively on the principle vārṇād aṅgaṃ balīyaḥ. They generally accept that aṅga-based (i.e., prakṛti-based) rules override phoneme-based ones, but they also engage in debates about whether this principle applies in sāmāna-āśraya (same conditioning factor) or vyāśraya (different conditioning factors). Nāgeśa, for instance, stresses that the paribhāṣā is supported by the jñāpaka of abhyāsasyāsavarṇe (6.4.78), where, without such a paribhāṣā, forms like īṣṭaḥ would collapse into incorrect outputs.",
      "historicity": "This paribhāṣā is not found in Vyāḍi, Śākaṭāyana, or Durgasiṃha’s Paribhāṣā texts, but it is present in other traditions. Its formulation in the Haima tradition is somewhat different, since Hemahaṃsagaṇi defines it as an exception to antarāṅga-bahiraṅga. Nandighoṣavijaya and Vijayalāvaṇyasūri both accept this, but they refine the definition by stressing the distinction between varṇa-based and prakṛti-based operations. In the Pāṇinian tradition, Mahābhāṣya provides the background debates on reduplication, vowel length, and the priority of rules, from which later commentators abstract this principle. Pāṇinian commentators like Nāgeśa and Śīradeva treat it under the form vārṇād aṅgaṃ balīyaḥ, where its application is extended to many contexts beyond those acknowledged by Hemahaṃsagaṇi. The Haima commentators restrict the scope to dhātu-based prakṛti, showing a more limited application compared to the Pāṇinian extension. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri notes that while in Pāṇini prakṛti includes nāma as well, Hemahaṃsagaṇi deliberately excludes nāma-prakṛti to avoid redundancy with vārṇa-based rules.",
      "observation": "Hemahaṁsagaṇi restricts the term prakṛti to verb roots and excludes nominal stems, arguing that effects tied to nouns are already handled by phoneme-based rules, so an extra lever is unnecessary; this explains why his examples are verb forms such as ūvatuḥ and ūvuḥ[cite: 2538, 2539]. Other Jain and Pāṇinian authors, reported by Nandighoṣavijaya, allow a wider scope that includes both nouns and verbs, and Vijayalāvaṇyasūri supports this with the Mahābhāṣya’s treatment of 8.2.6, where both categories count as prakṛti. Hemahaṁsagaṇi frames “vāṛṇāt prākṛtam” as an exception to the principle “antarāṅgaṃ bahiraṅgāt,” so a root-based process can override phoneme-sandhi when both apply to the same place, though he calls this principle “weak” because later rules in his corpus can limit its reach. Pāṇinian authors do not build weakness into the rule itself but instead set boundaries through explicit conditions and textual indicators. For Hemahaṁsagaṇi, the jñāpaka is functional: the absence of certain forms implies that a blocking rule must exist. Nandighoṣavijaya prefers a direct textual sign from Siddhahema, and Vijayalāvaṇyasūri anchors to Mahābhāṣya passages; meanwhile, Pāṇinian scholars point to abhyāsasya asavarṇe (6.4.78) and argue that unless this precedence is accepted, reduplicative forms like iyāya do not come out correctly, a line developed by Nāgeśa and Śīradeva[cite: 2544, 2545]. Debate continues over scope: Śīradeva limits it to same-site conflicts, while Haribhāskara allows careful cross-locus application in cases suggested by grammatical markers like ṅit. In worked examples, the Haima approach enforces the root-based step first to avoid errors like ūvatuḥ, while Pāṇinians prioritize differently, creating a layered set of priorities that nonetheless converge on correct outcomes. Historically, the rule is absent from some early schools but grows through Mahābhāṣya discussion into full paribhāṣā treatment; the Haima tradition narrows it, and the Pāṇinian school stabilizes it with stronger sūtraic anchors, showing two paths of development within the larger grammar tradition[cite: 2548, 2549].",
      "conclusion": "The paribhāṣā vārṇāt prākṛtam shows a point where the usual order of rules is modified. Normally, inner (antarāṅga) rules are applied before outer (bahiraṅga) ones. This maxim introduces an exception: when a root-based rule and a phoneme-based rule both apply, the root-based rule is given priority. Hemahaṃsagaṇi uses this to explain why certain forms are valid and why others are not within the SiddhaHema system. Nandighoṣavijaya and Vijayalāvaṇyasūri discuss where its authority comes from, showing a difference in method between the Haima and Pāṇinian approaches. Pāṇinian commentators such as Nāgeśa, Śīradeva, Pūruṣottama, and Haribhāskara extend this principle further, setting out its limits and testing it in a wide range of derivations. Across both traditions, the shared view is that root-based rules outrank phoneme-based ones in conflict. The key difference lies in justification: the Haima school relies on observed usage to establish the priority, while the Pāṇinian school looks for textual indicators (jñāpaka). Yet, both agree that without this maxim, derivations would not remain orderly. It functions to keep the system consistent, managing points of conflict between rules and preserving correct word formation.",
      "Meaning and Application": "This nyāya means that when two grammatical operations come into conflict, one based on a single sound (vārṇa) and another based on the root-form or stem (prakṛti), the prakṛti-based operation prevails. Hemahaṃsagaṇi clarifies that prakṛti here is not the nominal stem (nāma-rūpa) but the verbal root (dhātu-rūpa), since the functions associated with nominal stems are already included within sound-based operations. Thus, the paribhāṣā applies specifically where dhātu-based operations intersect with phoneme-based ones. The logic is that the prakṛti-based operation is stronger because it is tied to the underlying lexical unit, whereas the vārṇa-based one only depends on surface articulation. Hemahaṃsagaṇi also notes that this rule functions as an exception (apavāda) to the earlier paribhāṣā “antarāṅgaṃ bahiraṅgāt” (the internal operation overrides the external one). To illustrate, he considers forms like ūvatuḥ and ūvuḥ. In such cases, the yvuṛt (samprasāraṇa) and dviguṇa processes produce a double u, leading to a conflict between two rules: (1) the lengthening (dīrgha) of identical vowels due to their proximity (samānānāṃ tena dīrghaḥ 1.2.1), which is an antarāṅga (internal) operation [cite: 2500, 2502]; and (2) the rule dhātor i varṇaḥ (2.1.50), which prescribes uv before a vowel following the root, an operation dependent on the root as prakṛti and thus treated as bahiraṅga relative to the phoneme-based process. Normally, by the antarāṅga–bahiraṅga principle, the lengthening should occur first. But this paribhāṣā intervenes and asserts that because the operation is tied to the dhātu as prakṛti, it is stronger than the vārṇa-based rule, hence uv is applied first. Only afterwards does vowel lengthening occur, producing the correct forms. Without this principle, undesired forms like uvatūḥ would result."

    "text": {
      "source": "The jñāpaka of this paribhāsā given by Hemahaṃsagaṇi is derivation of upaśūya from upaśvi + ktvā. Here two rules compete. The first is “hṛsvasya taḥ pitkṛti” (H 4.4.113), which prescribes the augment t after a short vowel. This is a prākṛta operation because it depends directly on the natural base condition of a short vowel. The second is “yajādīvaceraḥ kiti” (H 4.1.79), which prescribes yvṛd substitution when the stem ends in a semivowel and a kit-affix follows. This is a varṇa-based operation. Hemahaṃsagaṇi states that according to this paribhāṣā, the yvṛd and the operations arising from it, such as dīrgha prescribed by “dīrgham avo ’ntyam” (4.1.103 Haima), take precedence over the t-augment. The source of this priority is not a general rule but the evidence of actual derivations like upaśūya. Thus, Hemahaṃsagaṇi accepts these derivations as the jñāpaka (indicator) of the paribhāṣā. Nandighoṣavijaya iconfirms this understanding. He explains that although the t-augment could be expected by virtue of the short vowel, it is blocked by the yvṛd. He also points out that after yvṛd, the subsequent dīrgha applies, and once this has occurred, the t-augment cannot operate. He concludes that such examples are the basis for recognising this paribhāṣā, although he notes that some later grammarians consider the nyāya unnecessary because its effects can be explained through reclassification of operations as varṇa- or prākṛta-based. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri, in his Taranga commentary, subjects the paribhāṣā to critical examination. He first analyses what exactly gives strength to yvṛd: whether it is a universal property (jāti) or an auxiliary condition (upādhi). He rejects both and concludes that yṛd operates through the specific designation (saṃjñā) that applies when certain sounds are replaced by semivowels. He then links this Haima paribhāṣā to the Pāṇinian context. In the Aṣṭādhyāyī, the parallel formulation is “saṃprasāraṇaṃ saṃprasāraṇāśrayaṃ ca kāryaṃ balīyaḥ”. This is discussed in the Mahābhāṣya under P 6.1.17: liṭy abhyāsasya ubhayeṣām. There, Patañjali examines why the wording ubhayeṣām was necessary and concludes that it ensures the precedence of saṃprasāraṇa and its dependent operations over other rules, such as halādiśeṣa. This shows that both in Haima and Pāṇinian traditions, the jñāpaka for this priority is not an explicit rule but the outcome of forms where yvṛd or saṃprasāraṇa must block other base-conditioned operations to yield the attested forms. Thus, the jñāpaka for Hemahaṃsagaṇi is the occurrence of forms like upaśūya where the yvṛd takes effect in spite of the presence of an earlier t-augment rule. Nandighoṣavijaya accepts the same and presents it in practical terms, while Vijayalāvaṇyasūri extends the discussion by connecting it with the Mahābhāṣya’s treatment of ubhayeṣām in P 6.1.17[cite: 2596, 2597]. In all cases, the basis of the paribhāṣā is not an abstract principle but concrete derivational evidence that necessitates recognising the superior force of yvṛd and its dependent processes.",
      "historicity": "Nandighoṣavijaya records that the separate statement of this nyāya is late. He attributes its paribhāṣā formulation to Bhoja. This nyāya is not listed in any of the earlier paribhāṣā collections. The commentary tradition shows that Hemahaṃsagaṇi is drawing on a well-established Pāṇinian principle, but adapting it into the Haima framework. In the Mahābhāṣya, the closest Pāṇinian parallel is found under Aṣṭādhyāyī 6.1.17 “liṭyabhyāsasya ubhayēṣām”. Patañjali explains why the wording ubhayēṣām was necessary. Without it, one might assume that only the reduplicated syllable (abhyāsa) undergoes saṃprasāraṇa; but by explicitly saying ubhayēṣām, Patañjali makes it clear that both the abhyāsa and the root can undergo the change[cite: 2604, 2605]. The examples of roots like vṛśc, grah, and bhṛj are given to show that if both abhyāsa and root are eligible, then saṃprasāraṇa applies in both places, and further operations dependent on it (such as pūrvārūpa) are also validated. This discussion is taken by later commentators as the classical jñāpaka for the principle that a sound-conditioned change (saṃprasāraṇa) and any rule dependent on it outrank other competing rules. When Hemahaṃsagaṇi formulates paribhāṣā “yvṛd yvṛdāśrayaṃ ca”, he is employing the same logic. In his example upaśveti from upaśu + kta, the t-augment (tāgama) would normally apply because of hṛsvasya pit kṛti (H 4.4.113), since the base ends in a short vowel. But Hemahaṃsagaṇi says this tāgama is overruled because the base also undergoes yvṛd (strengthening by glide insertion under H 4.1.79 yajādivaceḥ...). Once yvṛd operates, its dependent changes like vowel lengthening by dīrgham avo ’ntyam (H 4.1.103) also apply. Thus, even though the t āgama is directly tied to the base form, it is suppressed because yvṛd and its dependent results are stronger. This reasoning mirrors the Mahābhāṣya’s jñāpaka logic: a sound-conditioned operation and its dependent effects override competing base-conditioned rules. Later commentators confirm this connection. Nandighoṣavijaya stresses that Hemahaṃsagaṇi’s example itself is the prakāṭikāraka (the practical illustration) of the rule, because such derivations show its effect. He also notes that the principle’s strength (baliṣṭhatā) is not always transparent, indicating that Hemahaṃsagaṇi is systematizing what was already implicit. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri accepts this reading and connects it with the Pāṇinian saṃprasāraṇa maxim, but he does not introduce any separate jñāpaka beyond Hemahaṃsagaṇi’s own example. Haribhāskara, commenting in the Pāṇinian frame, similarly anchors the principle in the ubhayēṣām of P 6.1.17 and insists that without it operations like ā lopa would wrongly block saṃprasāraṇa. From a historical perspective, then, the Haima paribhāṣā “yvṛd yvṛdāśrayaṃ ca” is not an isolated invention but an adaptation of an already present Pāṇinian principle. Its placement shows Hemahaṃsagaṇi’s effort to recast the hierarchy of rules in his own system, while explicitly pointing to a derivational illustration as the jñāpaka. Later Haima and Pāṇinian commentators converge in recognising the Mahābhāṣya’s 6.1.17 as the underlying classical source, but diverge in how explicitly they accept Hemahaṃsagaṇi’s jñāpaka.",
      "observation": "This paribhāṣā highlights how the Haima tradition deals with conflict between prakṛtāśrita operations (those related to base form) and vārṇāśrita operations (those triggered by phonological change). Hemahaṃsagaṇi shows this clearly through the example of upaśveti. Here the tāgama expected from hṛsvasya pit kṛti (H 4.4.113) is set aside because the form is governed by yvṛd from yajādivaceḥ (H 4.1.79)[cite: 2620, 2621]. Once yvṛd is applied, the subsequent operation dīrgham avo ’ntyam (H 4.1.103) also follows. In this way we see Hemahaṃsagaṇi treating yvṛd and its dependent operations as stronger than t āgama. He adds that the actual forms serve as the prakāṭikāraka of the paribhāṣā, while also noting that its balavattva is not always obvious. Nandighoṣavijaya asks what exactly makes yvṛd stronger. He rejects the idea that yvṛd is a jāti, since it does not appear universally across forms. He also dismisses its status as an upādhi, because upādhi applies only under restricted conditions. Instead, he concludes that yvṛd should be seen as a specific operation (pratyeka-vṛtti), and that this very function gives it precedence[cite: 2627, 2628]. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri brings in the Pāṇinian side by comparing this Haima rule with saṃprasāraṇaṃ saṃprasāraṇāśrayaṃ ca kārya balīyaḥ. He points out that in the Pāṇinian tradition saṃprasāraṇa and its dependent effects take priority over ā-lopa and similar aṅga-based rules. He recalls the discussion under Aṣṭādhyāyī 6.1.17 (liṭyabhyāsasya ubhayēṣām), where the word ubhayēṣām ensures that both the abhyāsa and the root undergo saṃprasāraṇa. He notes that the Bhāṣyakāra himself questions whether the paribhāṣā is always needed, since pūrvavipratiṣedha can sometimes resolve the conflict. But Vijayalāvaṇyasūri still maintains that the paribhāṣā has value in cases like vivyādha and vivyadhitha, where without it the expected result would not be achieved. Śīradeva and Puruṣottama, in their Pāṇinian commentaries, apply the principle to forms like juhūṣati and juhuvatūḥ. They show that saṃprasāraṇa (and pūrvārūpa when relevant) must outrank ā-lopa and ik-vaṅ, otherwise later results such as uvaṅ, iyaṅ, and yaṇ would not appear. Puruṣottama directly cites the Mahābhāṣya and interprets the avargaṇa-grahaṇa in 6.3.112 (sahivahor odavarṇasya) as a jñāpaka that points to this priority. Śīradeva uses the example of brahmajyaḥ and āhvaḥ to argue the same point. Haribhāskara approaches the question slightly differently. He stresses that if the paribhāṣā is denied, then derivations such as ūḍhaḥ and ūḍhavān cannot be explained, and the rule would lose its relevance[cite: 2638, 2639]. He admits that the Bhāṣyakāra raised doubts about the necessity of the paribhāṣā, but he defends it on practical grounds of maintaining derivational consistency. From these different perspectives, we observe agreement on the basic point that phonological operations like yvṛd or saṃprasāraṇa, along with the changes dependent on them, take precedence over base-related rules such as t āgama or ā-lopa. But we also see differences in how commentators justify this precedence. Hemahaṃsagaṇi relies on usage, Nandighoṣavijaya on the independent operational force of yvṛd, Vijayalāvaṇyasūri on selective necessity, Śīradeva and Puruṣottama on textual jñāpaka, and Haribhāskara on consistency in derivation[cite: 2642, 2643]. These disagreements do not undermine the rule but rather show multiple strategies within the tradition to support the same principle of priority.",
      "conclusion": "The paribhāṣā yvṛd yvṛdāśrayaṃ ca establishes the principle that phonological changes such as yvṛd and the rules dependent upon them hold greater force than base-dependent operations like t āgama or ā-lopa. In the Haima system, Hemahaṃsagaṇi demonstrates this through actual derivational outcomes, showing that yvṛd applies first and then governs the sequence of further operations such as dīrgha. He treats the observable forms as the clearest proof of this priority. In the wider grammatical tradition, the same principle is expressed as saṃprasāraṇaṃ saṃprasāraṇāśrayaṃ ca kārya balīyaḥ. The Mahābhāṣya at P 6.1.17 provides the textual ground for this principle, with the inclusion of ubhayēṣām serving as a jñāpaka to ensure the simultaneous application of saṃprasāraṇa to both root and abhyāsa. Later commentators in the Pāṇinian tradition, Śīradeva, Puruṣottama, and Haribhāskara connect this paribhāṣā to forms like juhūṣati, juhuvatūḥ, and ūḍhaḥ, where it prevents base-dependent rules from blocking phonological results[cite: 2650, 2651]. The Haima and Pāṇinian traditions thus converge on the same structural insight: operations conditioned by sound change and their dependent effects must be given precedence over rules tied to the base form. At the same time, commentators differ in how they justify this precedence, whether by practical derivational outcomes, by the independent operational force of the rule, by textual jñāpaka, or by the need for consistency. Together, these perspectives confirm that the paribhāṣā serves as an important meta-rule, ensuring that grammatical processes proceed in an ordered and coherent way.",
      "Meaning and Application": "The paribhāṣā “yvṛd yṛdāśrayaṃ ca” states that a phonological change known as yṛd (substitution by a semivowel) and any operation that depends on yvṛd have greater force than other operations, even when those other operations are based on the natural or base form (prākṛta)[cite: 2563, 2564]. In other words, when there is a competition between a rule that is triggered directly by the base form and another that is conditioned by the presence of yvṛd or its effect, the latter takes precedence. Hemahaṃsagaṇi illustrates this with the form upaśūya. The underlying derivation is upaśvi + ktvā. According to the rule “anañāḥ ktvo yap”, the affix ktvā should first be replaced by yap, giving upaśvi + yap. At this point, two competing operations are possible. The first is the augment t from the rule “hṛsvasya taḥ pitkṛti” (4.4.113 Haima), which is a prākṛta-based operation because it depends on the short vowel in the base. The second is yṛd substitution triggered by “yajādīvaceraḥ kiti” (H 4.1.79), which is a varṇa-based change because it applies when the stem ends in a semivowel. According to this paribhāṣā, the yṛd substitution must occur first. Thus, upaśvi becomes upaśūya through yvṛd. Once this is done, the earlier t-augment does not apply, since it was already blocked by the priority of the yṛd. Further, once yṛd has operated, its dependent change in the form of vowel lengthening (dīrgha) through “dīrgham avo ’ntyam” (4.1.103 Haima) also applies. The dīrgha too takes precedence over the t-augment, because it is a direct consequence of the yvṛd. The practical application of this paribhāṣā is that whenever a yṛd operation or an operation dependent on yṛd coincides with a base-conditioned operation, the yṛd side must be carried out first, and the other operation will be set aside. Hemahaṃsagaṇi explicitly notes that such usages are the real indicators of the paribhāṣā, and its strength is understood from these derivational outcomes."

    "text": {
      "source": "Hemahaṃsagaṇi presents the nyāya in the Haima school as a priority instruction and gives the core example namasyati devān. He then tests its force against kruddruheṣyāsūyārthaiḥ yaṃ prati kopaḥ, and argues that if the nyāya were absolutely compelling, we would expect yasmai prati kopaḥ or even yasmai kopaḥ. Since usage gives yaṃ prati kopaḥ, he infers that the rule is not universally force-bearing in every environment. Nandighoṣavijaya disputes this reading. He points out that in yaṃ prati kopaḥ, kopaḥ is a noun that does not directly trigger the saṃpradāna of yad by the conditions of that aphorism. The semantics of prati with yaṃ favors dvitīyā and there is no independent saṃpradāna relation authorised for yad in that sentence. On his account, the Bhāṣya locus under sahayukte furnishes the vācanikī basis, and the yaṃ prati passage does not undermine the paribhāṣā. The Pāṇinian source is the Bhāṣya on sahayukte apradhāne where the vārttika states: sahayukte apradhānavacanaṃ anarthakam upapadavibhakteḥ kārakavibhaktibalīyastvād anyatrāpi. The Bhāṣyakāra then illustrates the generalisation with gāḥ svāmī vrajati, extracting the pattern that an upapadacase yields when a kārakacase competes. In this discussion, Patañjali does not treat the rule as an inference from scattered examples but as a stated principle embedded in the saha P 2.3.19 … rule. On this basis Nageśa in Paribhāṣenduśekhara classifies upapadavibhakteḥ kārakavibhaktir balīyasī as vācanikī, that is, directly stated in the Bhāṣya. He also clarifies what counts as kārakavibhakti: the case that expresses a verb-born relation, which for him includes prathamā as well, since the Bhāṣya under sahayukte presupposes prathamā as a kārakacase in the presence of competing upapada cues. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri also grounds the rule in the same Bhāṣya vārttika. He refines the definition of kārakavibhakti as kriyājanakaarthakavibhakti and explains that the caturthī of devāya namaḥ is not a kārakavibhakti unless it functions as the verb-born participant case. Hence, in namasyati devān the dvitīyā holds priority as the verb’s object case. He further notes that the Bhāṣya’s use of sahayukte shows how the upapada instruction becomes redundant once a stronger kāraka link is present, and that this redundancy is precisely what the vārttika marks. Purūṣottama ties the rule to a general program: upapadavibhaktis are basically ṣaṣṭhyapavāda style relation markers. When a genuine kāraka relation is intended, that relational upapada falls away as nonoperative, so the case built on the verb’s argument structure dominates. He extends the logic to other environments, such as the particle hā with vocative or nominative, and antarā in coordinated objects, to show how the verb-linked case takes precedence. Sīradeva and Haribhāskara both apply the rule to namasyati devān, rejecting caturthī from the upapada when the verb clearly selects an object. They also discuss particle-driven frames. Sīradeva uses adhi and pari as karmapravacanīyas with kutaḥ examples to show that a particle’s profile does not mechanically enforce a dvitīyā when the semantics point to apādāna pañcamī; the upshot is that the kāraka analysis decides the case and the particle’s upapada status does not override that analysis. Haribhāskara records a view that caturthī under namaḥ holds only when the lexeme falls under the specified list such as svarādi; when namaḥ behaves as a gati-like indicator joined with kṛ of prostration, karmaṇi dvitīyā applies. He notes poetic lines like rāvaṇāya namaskuryāḥ, and explains them by paraphrase of intent, not as counterevidence to the priority rule.",
      "historicity": "The priority of kāraka case over upapada case enters the paribhāṣā literature through the Mahābhāṣya’s treatment of saha… P 2.3.19, where the vārttika and the following remarks state the principle and discuss it with examples. This makes the rule an early Bhāṣya-level generalisation, not a later extraction. The paribhāṣā is adopted in the Haima tradition, but Hemahaṃsagaṇi limits it by referring contexts where the upapada reading is not overruled. Both Vijayalāvaṇyasūri and Nandighoṣavijaya classify this nyāya as vācanikī, aligning with Nageśa’s classification. The nyāya is absent in earliest Pāṇinian paribhāṣā texts of Vyaḍi. It is listed as a separate paribhāṣā for the first time in Cāndra tradition.",
      "observation": "The three most prominent Haima commentators' views differ on the scope of this rule. Hemahaṃsagaṇi tests the maxim against the expected dative in yaṃ prati kopaḥ and concludes that the rule's force is not universal (not nitya). Nandighoṣavijaya and Vijayalāvaṇyasūri reject this test case, arguing that no true kāraka conflict exists there, thus affirming that the priority rule itself remains valid[cite: 2707, 2741]. All schools agree that a case established by the verb’s argument structure (kārakavibhakti) is stronger than a case established by a particle's mere presence (upapadavibhakti)[cite: 2702, 2710]. The Mahābhāṣya treats the rule as vācanikī (explicitly stated)[cite: 2673, 2730]. Pāṇinian scholars confirm that the rule is necessary to resolve competition in environments like namasyati devān (where the Accusative/Dvitīyā wins over the Dative/Caturthī). The priority is active only when a genuine competition arises between two possible case sources[cite: 2708, 2726].",
      "conclusion": "The discussion of the paribhāṣā upapadavibhakteḥ kārakavibhaktiḥ in the Haima tradition shows Hemahaṃsagaṇi’s attempt to establish the greater strength of kāraka-based case assignment over upapada-based assignment. His core example is namasyati devān. Hemahaṃsagaṇi explains that the jñāpaka for this principle is found in yaṃ prati kopaḥ (H 2.2.27). By placing this nyāya in his Nyāyasaṃgraha, Hemahaṃsagaṇi brings the logic of weighing upapada- and kāraka-based case assignment into the Haima grammatical system. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri classifies the paribhāṣā as vācanikī rather than jñāpakasiddhā. Haribhāskara accepts the rule but applies it only when both upapada- and kāraka-vibhaktis are equally possible. The Haima school treats this paribhāṣā for resolving conflicts between upapada and karaka based case assignments, but always within specific contexts. It works as a balancing rule that does not override the main structure of kāraka-vibhakti assignment in the Haima system.",
      "Meaning and Application": "The paribhāṣā upapadabhakteḥ kārakavibhaktir balīyasī states that when both an upapada-vibhakti and a kāraka-vibhakti apply to the same word, the kāraka-vibhakti prevails. Upapada-vibhakti arises from the association of a noun, indeclinable, or particle with a particular word, as in namaḥ in devāya namaḥ, which gives caturthī. Kāraka-vibhakti arises from the direct relation of a word with a verb as agent, object, instrument, recipient, source, or locus. In namasyati devān, namaḥ as an upapada could assign caturthī, but deva is also the direct object of namasyati, which requires dvitīyā as karmavibhakti. According to this paribhāṣā, the karmavibhakti overrides the upapada-vibhakti, and the form becomes devān. The same logic explains vocative or nominative priority in calls or exclamations with particles, and tritīyā or other kārakacases in constructions with saha, adhi, pari where a particle proposes an upapadacase but the verb’s participant role dictates another case. The rule is a conflict resolver: when both readings remain available and distinct, the case signaled by the verb’s kāraka relation prevails over the case licensed by the upapada."

    "text": {
      "source": "Hemahaṃsagaṇi links this paribhāṣā with the phrase pratyayottarapade in the sūtra 2.1.11 (tvamau pratyayottarapade caikasmin). He argues that the addition of pratyayottarapade indicates that the intended tvamāv substitutions will not always apply automatically, because the lup of the case affix may intervene. This functions as the jñāpaka for the principle that lup overrides antarāṅga rules. Nandighoṣavijaya accepts this reading and interprets the pratyayottarapade clause as a clear indicator of this paribhāṣā. He explains that without this clause, the forms tvadīyaḥ and madīyaḥ would be derived directly from the substitution rules. The addition of pratyayottarapade serves to prevent such automatic application and points to the precedence of lup. He further notes that in Haima grammar, lup is not treated as preserving sthānivadbhāva, which also explains why rules dependent on the elided affix (like vṛddhi) do not proceed after the lup. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri disagrees with Hemahaṃsagaṇi’s view that pratyayottarapade must be treated as a jñāpaka. He argues that if the phrase were only to restrict tva/ma substitutions, then it would become an apavāda to the general rule “tava mama ṅasā”. But since apavāda must share the same domain of application as utsarga, this interpretation would render the provision redundant. He instead explains that the phrase pratyayottarapade has independent significance for the correct assignment of mānta forms and thus cannot be treated solely as a jñāpaka for this paribhāṣā. Still, he accepts the functional existence of the rule, citing other bhāṣya contexts. Nāgeśa, in the Paribhāṣenduśekhara, discusses this paribhāṣā at length. He records different views: some consider it a jñāpaka-siddha rule from 7.2.98, while others see it as directly vācīnika in the Bhāṣya, since Patañjali himself states that the rule demonstrates how lug overrides antarāṅga operations. Nāgeśa finally holds that in the bhāṣya style it is vācīnika, whereas in the vārttika style it can be treated as jñāpaka. Thus he recognizes both perspectives.",
      "historicity": "This paribhāṣā is absent in early paribhāṣā texts like Vyādi’s Paribhāṣāsūcana, Śākaṭāyana, and the Kātantra tradition, but appears in both Haima and later Pāṇinian collections. In the Pāṇinian school, the Bhāṣya on 7.2.98 (pratyayottarapadayośca) raises the question why such a sūtra is needed when 7.2.97 (tvamāv ekavacane) already provides the substitution. Patañjali answers that the additional provision is necessary because lup can block antarāṅga substitutions like tva/ma. The Mahābhāṣya thus preserves the principle in exact form. Kaiyaṭa interprets this as evidence that lug is stronger even when antarāṅga rules are ready to operate. In the Haima school, Hemahaṃsagaṇi states it as a distinct paribhāṣā. Nandighoṣavijaya and Vijayalāvaṇyasūri debate whether the source clause (pratyayottarapade) should be taken as jñāpaka, but they agree that the principle itself is accepted in the Haima framework. In later Pāṇinian tradition, commentators like Purūṣottama and Śīradeva cite the same Bhāṣya passage and confirm the principle, sometimes treating it as vācīnika. Nāgeśa presents many interpretations from Kaiyyaṭta to Hardatta. His disagreement concerns its status as jñāpaka-siddha or vācīnika, not the rule itself.",
      "observation": "This paribhāṣā is accepted across the different grammatical tradtion but there is the question of the scope of lup and whether it applies uniformly across all contexts. Hemahaṃsagaṇi presents the example of gargāḥ, where the lup of yañ prevents vṛddhi. But he also adds a more case, tvadīyaḥ and madīyaḥ, where the elision of the case affix (lup) prevents antarāṅga substitutions (tvamāv)[cite: 2803, 2804]. This shows that the rule is not limited to taddhita derivations like yañ but extends to pronominal substitutions as well. Nandighoṣavijaya clarifies that within the Haima tradition lup is treated differently from luk. A luk affix retains sthānivadbhāva, and rules dependent on it can still operate. A lup affix, however, does not retain sthānivadbhāva. Thus no rule that depends on the elided affix can apply afterwards. This explanation strengthens the principle of lup overriding antarāṅga rules, since the condition for the antarāṅga operation is removed. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri introduces another dimension. He argues that if pratyayottarapade in H 2.1.11 is explained only as a jñāpaka for this principle, then it would unnecessarily become an apavāda to “tava mama ṅasā”. He sees this as problematic because utsarga and apavāda should apply to the same domain. To avoid this, he insists that pratyayottarapade has a distinct role in relation to the manta-forms, and therefore it cannot be reduced to a jñāpaka for the precedence of lup. His interpretation shows a caution against overextending the jñāpaka-method. Śīradeva and Haribhāskara both emphasise the practical outcome of the rule in forms like gomatpriyaḥ or gomatyate. They point out that even though num and related rules are antarāṅga, the lup of case affixes blocks them. Both note that the Bhāṣya explicitly places lug above antarāṅga rules, and so they take this paribhāṣā as directly grounded in bhāṣya rather than as an inferred jñāpaka. Purūṣottama similarly treats the rule as necessary for explaining why forms like gomatpriyaḥ or gomatyate do not show num despite its antarāṅga status. His observation shows how the paribhāṣā ensures consistency between grammatical derivation and linguistic data. Nāgeśa records the divergent opinions. Some scholars take the paribhāṣā as jñāpaka-siddha, derived from the insertion of pratyayottarapade in 2.1.11, while others treat it as vācīnika, explicitly stated in the Bhāṣya on 7.2.98. Nāgeśa does not reject either view but explains that the difference lies in interpretive method: those working in vārttika-style accept the jñāpaka, while those following the bhāṣya-style prefer to treat it as vācīnika. In the Mahābhāṣya, we see that Patañjali raises the very question why 7.2.98 is needed when 7.2.97 already provides the substitution. His answer is that without it the antarāṅga rule (tvamāv) would operate even when lup is available. The sūtra therefore signals that lup has higher force. Kaiyaṭa’s commentary highlights this aspect and uses the principle “utsarga-samāna-deśā apavādāḥ” to support the precedence of lup. This shows that even in the Pāṇinian school, the exceptional position of lup was not taken as obvious and needed explicit statement. Altogether, the commentaries reveal a agreement on the operational dominance of lup, but they differ in justification. Some base it on sthānivadbhāva distinction (Haima view), some on jñāpaka inference (Hemahaṃsagaṇi, Nandighoṣa), some on bhāṣya testimony (Śīradeva, Haribhāskara, Nāgeśa), and some reject the jñāpaka reading to protect other rules from redundancy (Vijayalāvaṇyasūri).",
      "conclusion": "This paribhāṣā is about the the strength of lup in the hierarchy of grammatical rules. While antarāṅga takes precedence in the usual cases, the nyāya ensures that forms like gargāḥ, tvadīyaḥ, and madīyaḥ conform to correct usage by giving priority to the elision of affixes. Hemahaṃsagaṇi makes it a distinct nyāya in the Haima system. Nandighoṣavijaya supports it through the non-sthānivad status of lup. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri disagrees about the jñāpaka in 2.1.11 but accepts the rule as valid. Pāṇinian commentators like Śīradeva, Haribhāskara, and Purūṣottama rely on the Bhāṣya’s statement. Nāgeśa frames the debate on its status as jñāpakasiddha or nyāyasiddha. Despite these different justifications, the agreement on the functional precedence of lup shows the central concern of both traditions to preserve correct derivations even when it means altering the usual antarāṅga–bahiraṅga hierarchy.",
      "Meaning and Application": "The paribhāṣā lup antarāṅgebhyaḥ states that even when an antarāṅga rule is available, a bahiraṅga operation of lup (elision) can prevail. Normally, the principle antarāṅgaṃ bahiraṅgāt establishes that an operation dependent only on a nearby element (antarāṅga) has precedence over one dependent on a more external element (bahiraṅga). In this paribhāṣā, an exception is introduced: when the rule of lup applies, it overrides antarāṅga operations. Hemahaṃsagaṇi illustrates this with the derivation “gargāḥ.” From the base “garga + yañ + jas,” both vṛddhi (H 7.4.1 “vṛddhiḥ svareṣv-ādeḥ…”) and the lup of yañ (6.1.124 “bahuṣv-striyām”) are applicable. Vṛddhi is an antarāṅga rule since it depends on the vowel of the base. Lup is bahiraṅga as it is dependent on the affix. In this case, the lup applies first, preventing the vṛddhi. Thus the form “gargāḥ” is obtained. Hemahaṃsagaṇi also cites another context: in words like tvadīyaḥ and madīyaḥ, the expected tva and ma substitutions (7.2.97 “tvamāv ekavacene”) depend only on case affixes and are therefore antarāṅga. But the lup of the case affix after a derivative affix (pratyayottarapade) blocks those substitutions. Therefore, this paribhāṣā establishes that in certain conditions, lup takes precedence even over antarāṅga operations."

    "text": {
      "source": "Hemahaṃsagaṇi justify the paribhāṣā in two places. First, he invokes the gobalīvarda principle to justify that the word lopa here subsumes adr̥śana processes signalled as it, for example, under aprayogīit where et, apagacchati etc. receive the meaningful it-saṃjñā. He notes that such adr̥śana falls under lopa in na vṛddhiś cāv iti kiḍillope, therefore, the sarvebhyo lopaḥ reading should be taken to include that class. Second, he treats “sastaḥ si” through a viṣaya-saptamī. If one were to read its saptamī as nimitta-saptamī there, a sic-lopa forced by this paribhāṣā would preempt the sa condition and prevent the sūtra from ever applying. This reading avoids a direct clash between sarvebhyo lopaḥ and sastaḥ si. He argues that if one took a nimitta saptamī there, a sic-lopa forced by this paribhāṣā would preempt the sa condition and prevent the sūtra from ever applying. He lets the sa conditioned operation apply while sic is present, then allows sic to delete. This is the jñāpaka he offers for the priority of lopa. Vyādi formulates the same priority as “sarvavidhibhyo lopavidhiḥ balavān.” His jñāpaka is “pratyayalope pratyayalakṣaṇam”. If one were to permit all pratyaya-based operations first and then delete the pratyaya, the rule would be idle. The akṣara-economy of the Aṣṭādhyāyī requires the opposite reading: the pratyaya deletes first, hence pratyayalakṣaṇa must be supplied at the point of deletion. Vyādi also shows the purpose with “te santi”: the aster lopa precedes the ādeśa and thereby blocks anajāditva consequences. Puruṣottama and Sīradeva adopt this jñāpaka. They both state that “pratyayalope pratyayalakṣaṇam” would be pointless unless lopa were prior to other pratyaya -dependent operations, and they restate the “te santi” use-case. They add that the Mahābhāṣya does not explicitly install the paribhāṣā, since the required outputs can be derived by other priors such as “varṇād aṅga balīyaḥ.” Haribhāskara does not accept the jñāpaka in this domain. He argues that the ordering in cases like kāni santi and yaiṇaḥ follows from paratva and nityatva alone. He adds that “akṛtavyūha” prevents anticipatory application of yaṇ to motivate the priority of lopa. Nāgeśa, in brief notes, records that sarvavidhibhyo lopavidhiḥ and iḍvidhiś ca balavān are not Bhāṣya-based. He therefore treats them as later interpretive conventions rather than vācānika Bhāṣya doctrine. With respect to Hemahaṃsagaṇi’s own jñāpaka, Vijayalavaṇyasūri does not contest his use of sastaḥ si as a domain-restricting device, but he remarks that even without this paribhāṣā the needed derivations can be obtained by paratva and by choosing the direct interpretation “sākṣād vyañjane” in īr vyañjane’yapi. Nandighoṣa accepts that lopa should cover both lúk and lup here and notes, in line with Hemahaṃsagaṇi, that it-adr̥śana also belongs under lopa.",
      "historicity": "The paribhāṣā sarvebhyo lopavidhiḥ balavān does not appear in the early grammatical discussion. In the Mahābhāṣya, while several issues about lopa are discussed, including its interaction with other rules and the principle of sthānivadbhāva, this nyāya is not stated. The idea of lopa taking precedence is, however, present in the form of explanatory remarks, such as in the interpretation of pratyayalope pratyayalakṣaṇam (P 1.1.62), which Vyādi later identifies as the jñāpaka for this paribhāṣā. It appears as a paribhāṣā for the first tiim in later paribhāṣā collections. Vyādi in his Paribhāṣāsūcana formulates it as sarvavibhibhyo lopavidhiḥ balavān. He uses the general context of affix-deletion as his justification. This sets the precedent for later grammarians, who often cite P 1.1.62 as its textual basis. Bhoja also lists this nyāya in his grammatical system. In the Haima tradition, Hemahaṃsagaṇi includes the nyāya in his Nyāyasaṃgraha. He interprets it with reference to examples like abuddha and śaṃsthāḥ. The Siddha-Haima system thus treats it as an essential paribhāṣā and not as a derivative of other maxims such as lupantarāṅgebhyaḥ. Among the Jain and other non-Pāṇinian schools, the rule’s acceptance is varied. In post-Pāṇinian works like the Paribhāṣenduśekhara of Nageśa, the paribhāṣā is discussed critically. Nageśa and others recognise that some commentators considered it jñāpakasiddha, but he himself does not affirm this status because of the absence of direct reference in the Mahābhāṣya. Commentators disagree on whether the Mahābhāṣya implies it by the necessary use of pratyayalope pratyayalakṣaṇam. Puruṣottama and Sīradeva accept that implication but Haribhāskara denies it. Nāgeśa emphasises Bhāṣya silence. The nyāya developed from implicit reasoning in the Mahābhāṣya, formulated in later paribhāṣā texts like Vyādi’s, and was later integrated in both the Haima and Pāṇinian traditions, though not without debate about its independent necessity.",
      "observation": "There are a lot of disagreements about the nature, application and necessity of this nyāya which I have presented one by one. The first point of disagreement is regarding the denotation of lopa. Hemahaṃsagaṇi initially narrows lopa to lúk in this nyāya because he has already assigned lup a separate priority rule. Nandighoṣa prefers to retain both lúk and lup under sarvebhyo lopaḥ, and he extends it to it-adr̥śana through a prayogīit. Vijayalavaṇyasūri underscores the practical difference that lup does not license sthānivad for its own trigger so a lup-based deletion not only happens first but also suppresses any effect whose nimitta is the deleted element; lúk can still allow sthānivad effects where independently sanctioned[cite: 2897, 2898]. This explains why seluk can be a cause of dīrgha in gomān, while lup cannot be a cause for dīrgha in gomatkulam. The second point is the role of jñāpaka. Hemahaṃsagaṇi’s viṣaya saptamī reading in sastaḥ si is designed to avoid a conflict that would otherwise arise if lopa always operated first. Vyādi’s jñāpaka is structural: pratyayalope pratyayalakṣaṇam presupposes that lopa has already applied. Haribhāskara insists that the needed order can be secured by paratva and nityatva without installing a new paribhāṣā. Nāgeśa rejects the nyāya on the basis that it is not Bhāṣya-vācānika. The third is interaction with other nyāyas. Hemahaṃsagaṇi anticipates that sarvebhyo lopaḥ would be overridden by lopāt svarādeśaḥ where applicable and calls it weak on that account. Nandighoṣa makes the same point and uses it to argue that one cannot fold the earlier lupantaraṅgebhyaḥ into sarvebhyo lopaḥ, otherwise both would collapse under the later lopāt svarādeśaḥ. Vijayalavaṇyasūri says that being bādhya does not mean being weak, because bādhya-bādhaka relations are not a measure of the strength of a nyāya. A fourth point is the strategy for sastaḥ si. Hemahaṃsagaṇi’s viṣaya saptamī avoids a direct clash between sarvebhyo lopaḥ and sastaḥ si. He argues that if one took a nimitta saptamī there, a sic-lopa forced by this paribhāṣā would preempt the sa condition and prevent the sūtra from ever applying. This design also explains why īr can be read “sākṣād vyañjane” so that it does not depend on a now-deleted kvip.",
      "conclusion": "The paribhāṣā codifies a simple ordering of deletion in the sense of non-appearance is evaluated before other rule effects. In Haima grammar, it is used as a general priority for lúk, with lup governed by its own constraints. The immediate consequence is that many operations that depend on a visible segment never get a chance to apply, unless a domain device such as a viṣaya saptamī preserves them long enough. The Pāṇinian material contains an early statement of the same idea in Vyādi ; later authors disagree on whether the Mahābhāṣya commits to it. In Haima school, it predicts the ordering in abuddha, śaṃsthāḥ, and sastaḥ si type derivations without assumptions, and it integrates with the restrictions on lup. The disagreements in different scholars concern how one justifies the metarule and how widely one extends the word lopa. Those disagreements do not affect the core effect of the principle that when a deletion is available, the grammar treats it as structurally before other operations, unless a restriction keeps a necessary trigger visible before deletion.",
      "Meaning and Application": "The paribhāṣā states that a lopavidhi operates before and overrides other vidhis that compete for the same environment. Hemahaṃsagaṇi clarifies that although the word lopa can denote both lup and lúk, the present nyāya should be read with lúk (adr̥śana) as the primary target because lup has already been handled under a prior nyāya. The operational claim is that when a deletion in the sense of non-appearance is available, it applies first and thereby prevents later rules from seeing its operation. Hemahaṃsagaṇi’s examples make the scope concrete. In abuddha (from a√budh with sic), the sic-segment disappears first. Because that deletion precedes other operations, the later rule “gaḍadavādeś caturthāntasyaikasvarasyādeś caturthaḥ rdhyvoś ca pratyaye” cannot effect the caturthaādeśa on the initial consonant. Similarly, in śaṃsthāḥ with kvip, the kvip disappears first and blocks īr under īr vyañjane’yapi from lengthening the ā of √sthā. Hemahaṃsagaṇi also analyses the well-known sastaḥ si domain by choosing a viṣaya saptamī for si: the sūtra sastaḥ si applies while sic is still visible, and only afterwards does sic undergo lúk, so that preposed changes that require visible s can take effect and only then does deletion occur. The same ordering logic explains vaser adyatanī tām, avāttām types: sastaḥ is set up while sic is present, then sic is deleted, and finally the vṛddhi that presupposes a visible consonant is allowed by sthānivad where admissible. The effect is a two-tier reading. First, lúk applies against all competing operations, even when those are “antaranga.” Second, where lup is the deletion, additional constraints apply, because lup lacks sthānivad for its own trigger by and hence also blocks any nimittakārya tied to the deleted element. Vijayalavaṇyasūri uses this to explain the contrast between gomān with seluk and gomatkulam: seluk allows sthānivad and therefore dīrgha triggered by it; lup does not."

      "source": "Hemahaṃsagaṇi gives an internal jñāpaka. He notes that the vṛddhi-sūtra is placed before avarṇe varṇasya in his Haima ordering of sūtra, and he takes that pre-placement as a sign of priority. He argues that if this nyāya did not hold, one should have re-ordered the rules so that (H 7.4.1) stands explicitly after “avarṇe varṇasya” to force vṛddhi only by paratva. Since the text does not do that, the earlier placement serves as a jñāpaka that svarādeśa outranks the luk implied by 7.4.68. He also states that this nyāya is an apavāda to N 48, “sarvebhyo lopaḥ,” by again restricting “lopa” here to luk. Nandighoṣavijaya accepts this Haima-internal jñāpaka in its own context. He repeats that we should construe lopa as luk in N 49 because N 49 is an apavāda to N 48. He further says that Hemahaṃsagaṇi’s jñāpaka works inside the Haima system because the vṛddhi-sūtra’s earlier placement is intentional. He then adds an important point that in the Pāṇinian grammar the placement is different, and one can often get the same effect by paratva so this particular nyāya is not required there. Vijaylāvaṇyasūri does not reject the precedence itself but challenges this particular jñāpaka as general evidence. He argues that mere pre-placement rarely proves a global precedence rule; even without the nyāya, śrāyaṃ can be derived by regular ordering or by invoking spardhā “when two rules of equal strength compete, the intended one holds”. For Pāṇini’s ordering, he points to Siddhānta-Kaumudī’s practice of deriving ādivṛddhi after the relevant lopa because of paratva. Thus, it should be considered that this maxim, if taken as jñāpaka-siddha, fails in its own context. Hence, the maxim lopāt svarādeśaḥ is not supported by the mere order of rules but must rest on other considerations. If only its own context is meant, it has no significance.",
      "historicity": "The paribhāṣā appears for the first time in Durgasimha’s commentary in the Kaṭantra tradition. In the Haima tradition, “sarvebhyo lopaḥ” and “lopāt svarādeśaḥ” appear as a designed sequence, the first states default strength in favour of lopa (understood broadly as luk-type adarśana), and the second assigns exception in favour of svarādeśa when the two collide. This two-step articulation seems to be a Haima choice. Nandighoṣavijaya notes that the comparable statement does not occur in early non-Haima collections such as Śākaṭāyana, Cāndra, and Jaina paribhāṣā lists possibly because they also follow the same rule ordering. In the Pāṇinian school, later commentators tend to avoid a standalone maxim because ordinary ordering and specific jñāpakas already secure the desired outcomes.",
      "observation": "Hemahaṃsagaṇi interprets lopa in this paribhāṣā specifically as luk, and he treats it as an apavāda to the earlier rule “sarvebhyo lopaḥ”. This limitation is deliberate, because if lopa were taken in its broader sense the principle would clash with the previous Haima rule lub antarāṅgebhyaḥ, where lug can even override certain antarāṅga operations. The choice of jñāpaka is handled differently across the traditions. In the Haima system, the signal is taken from the order of sūtras. In the Kaṭantra school Durgasiṃha identifies sāvau silopaś ca as the textual sign. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri is less willing to rely on such pre-placement as a general principle. He argues that precedence can often be explained by paratva or by spardhā. He also draws on more specific Pāṇinian jñāpakas where vṛddhi has already been given priority. Although the textual anchors differ, all commentators agree that some form of precedence is required. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri also introduces a caution. He warns that if the rule were interpreted as a blanket “vowel substitution over every lopa,” it would lead to ativyāpti. He prefers narrower or case-based formulations rather than a universal rule. The relation with the earlier rule sarvebhyo lopaḥ is also discussed by all the commentators of Haima tradtion. Nandighoṣavijaya points out that if it is made too wide in scope, it would nullify the earlier nyāya. The Kaṭantra school comes to a similar position. Durgasiṃha’s examples demonstrate that if silopa were to be applied first, the intended vowel substitution would be lost or distorted. The Pāṇinian background also shows consistency with the need for such precedence but does not frame it as a separate maxim. In many derivations, paratva itself secures the right order. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri’s preference to treat spardhā as a choice for the desired form and his reliance on paratva belong to this strategy.",
      "conclusion": "The nyāya “lopāt svarādeśaḥ” establishes a exception to “sarvebhyo lopaḥ.” In Haima tradition it means that when a luk -type lopa and a vowel substitution both target the same segment, perform the substitution and let the luk drop out. Hemahaṃsagaṇi supports this with a jñāpaka based on the ordering of the vṛddhi-sūtra. Nandighoṣavijaya accepts the Haima jñāpaka for the Haima text and adds that this priority is not absolute because sūtra spardhā and śiṣṭaprayoga can force exceptions. Vijaylāvaṇyasūri prefers to ground the precedence in paratva or, more specific jñāpakas. Durgasiṃha in the Kaṭantra school states the same precedence. The nyāya is accepted by all major traditions for its functional utility.",
      "Meaning and Application": "Hemahaṃsagaṇi states that when a lopa rule and a svarādeśa rule compete, the svarādeśa is stronger. He asks to attach balavān here and in the following seven nyāyas, so the operative sense is: “from among competing operations, the vowel-substitution takes precedence over lopa.” He also clarifies the scope of lopa in this nyāya. Here lopa means luk (adarśana, zero-realisation with sthānivad where appropriate), not lup (true deletion without sthānivad). The reason is structural because the nyāya functions as an apavāda to the immediately preceding nyāya “sarvebhyo lopaḥ”, where lopa was established as generally strongest. In N 49, Hemahaṃsagaṇi narrows the target to luk-type lopa and then asserts that svarādeśa overrides it. His example of the application is the derivative like śrāyaṃ havis. In that case, “ avarṇe varṇasya ” (H 7.4.68) would trigger ī-lug. The nyāya “ lopāt svarādeśaḥ ” blocks that and lets vṛddhi go through under “vṛddhiḥ svareṣv ādeḥ” (H 7.4.1). Thus, the rule implied by Hemahaṃsagaṇi is when a vowel-substitution and a luk of that vowel are both applicable, do the substitution first and treat the lug as blocked. In the Kaṭantra school, Durgasiṃha formulates the same priority more directly as “lopasvarādeśayoḥ svarādeśo vidhir balavān.”"

      "source": "Hemahaṃsagaṇi does not provide a direct Mahābhāṣya passage as the jñāpaka. Instead, he frames the maxim as part of the internal Haima ordering system. His example from arpayati is used to justify why an insertion must sometimes come first. He also signals its non-absolute scope by mentioning dvayoḥ kulayor, where the nāgama does not override ādveraḥ. Thus the jñāpaka is implicit in the Haima practice rather than textual citation. Nandighoṣavijaya connects the maxim to the structure of the sūtras. He says that the placement of vṛddhiḥ svareṣv ādeḥ after avarṇe varṇasya acts as a signal. If there were no such maxim, the vṛddhi rule should have been placed earlier. Since it is not, the maxim is inferred. He also argues that ṛto raḥ svare ’ni (2.1.2) provides a direct jñāpaka: the exclusion of n-āgama by the word ani is meaningful only if the n-āgama would otherwise have applied earlier than the substitution. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri is skeptical of treating pre-placement as a general jñāpaka. He notes that in many cases paratva suffices to derive the correct order. Where that is not enough, he appeals to the metarule mitravat āgamaḥ, śatruvat ādeśaḥ. He also reminds that āgamas can be explained by sthānivadbhāva, giving them kṛtākṛta-prasakti, the ability to function whether the ādeśa has applied or not. This allows the same outcome without creating a separate universal maxim. His view is that the maxim can be accepted but is not strictly required.",
      "historicity": "The maxim has no independent standing in the Pāṇinian system. In Pāṇini, most conflicts between āgama and ādeśa can be settled by paratva. For example, the placement of vṛddhi rules and āgama rules in 6.4 creates a natural sequencing. Where this does not resolve the issue, commentators invoke local jñāpakas or use the principle of spardhā (where two rules of equal force compete, the desirable result is chosen). The Mahābhāṣya itself demonstrates these strategies in many contexts, but it does not record ādeśād āgamaḥ as a general paribhāṣā. In the Haima tradition Hemahaṃsagaṇi includes it as part of a sequence of precedence rules after sarvebhyo lopaḥ (48) and lopāt svarādeśaḥ (49). Its inclusion maintains the internal structure of Haima derivations, particularly in places where an insertion like pva or na would be lost if a substitution applied first. He limits its strength by admitting that it does not always override paratva or antarāṅga. Nandighoṣavijaya stresses that the maxim must be read as an apavāda to the earlier rule. He gives arpayati as its main example, but he also acknowledges that where tradition accepts a different outcome, as in cikīrṣyate (where a-lopa wins over dīrgha), the maxim cannot be applied absolutely[cite: 3026, 3027]. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri points out that similar results are already explained in Pāṇinian commentaries without a separate maxim. He therefore treats the maxim as supported by older metarules such as mitravat āgamaḥ rather than as a new principle. This indicates that its independent formulation in the Haima school is a later step, tailored to specific Haima derivations rather than reflecting an ancient shared rule.",
      "observation": "The commentaries converge on the practical need for ordering. If an ādeśa acts too early, the environment required for an āgama disappears. In arpayati, if vṛddhi had already changed ṛ to ār, there would be no way to insert pva. Hence some device is needed to guarantee that the āgama acts first. Hemahaṃsagaṇi achieves this by positing a named precedence. Nandighoṣavijaya shows how the placement of rules signals the same precedence. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri reconstructs it through paratva, spardhā, and sthānivadbhāva. The disagreement lies in the scope and necessity. Hemahaṃsagaṇi presents it as a distinct maxim but fences it with limits, calling it a viśeṣa. Nandighoṣavijaya supports it but adds that it is anitya, since practice sometimes demands the opposite order. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri sees it as dispensable, useful in some derivations, but not required universally because general principles already provide the ordering.",
      "conclusion": "The paribhāṣā ādeśād āgamaḥ responds to a real problem of sequencing between substitution and insertion. All commentators agree that in derivations like arpayati the āgama must go first, otherwise the attested form is lost. They disagree on method and status. Hemahaṃsagaṇi names it as a paribhāṣā but accepts that it is not universally applicable. Nandighoṣavijaya affirms its role but marks it anitya, overridden by usage. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri shows how it can be derived from general principles and therefore treats it as non-essential, though acceptable when invoked. The Haima tradition preserves it as a distinct maxim because of its importance for Haima derivations. The Pāṇinian tradition does not recognise it separately, since paratva and other principles suffice. The Kaṭantra paribhāṣā texts shows that the same ordering problem was noticed in parallel traditions. The outcome across traditions is that an āgama can be given priority when required, but the need for this nyāya used to justify this priority vary.",
      "Meaning and Application": "The paribhāṣā ādeśād āgamaḥ establishes a precedence rule when both an ādeśa (substitution) and an āgama (insertion) compete in the same derivational environment. It states that the āgama takes place before the ādeśa. Hemahaṃsagaṇi explains this with the case arpayati. The base ṛ would ordinarily undergo vṛddhi, but Hemahaṃsagaṇi says that the pva-āgama intervenes first, after which guṇa operates by puṣpau[cite: 2994, 2995]. This produces the correct intermediate steps and final form. Here the āgama must outrank the substitution, because once vṛddhi has replaced ṛ with ār, the intended insertion cannot take hold. He extends the test to contexts such as dvayoḥ kulayor with anāmsvare no’ntaḥ and ādveraḥ. If the maxim were always effective, nāgama would override the competing substitution even where paratva and antarāṅga would naturally secure the ādeśa. But this is not the case. Hemahaṃsagaṇi therefore treats the maxim as a special device with a limited range. He calls its force kṣāmatva, meaning it works where needed but does not cancel every rival operation."

    "text": {
      "source": "The jñāpaka of this nyāya is found in the sūtrs ṛto raḥ svare’ni. Hemahaṃsagaṇi interprets the word ani as an exclusion, which blocks n -related changes from happening until after the substitution is done. His reason is that if the substitution does not occur first, n-āgama would be given priority because of earlier rules and the substitution would not be applicable. If that were the case, the exclusion provided by ani would serve no clear function. The broad terminology used by Hemacandra, such as ani instead of anābhi, leads Hemahaṃsagaṇi to conclude that the exclusion was meant to enforce the precedence of substitution over insertion. He states about the stability of this rule. Hemahaṃsagaṇi does not see this precedence as unstable or subject to exceptions in its specific domain. Nandighoṣavijaya while explaining the jñāpaka from ṛto raḥ svare ’ni discusses the doubt about āgama as svādu and thus not a vyavadhāyin. He answers by narrowing the svādu relation. The n-āgama does not become svādu with respect to the tri -segment that is the subject of the tisraḥ sarvādeśa. It can therefore function as vyavadhāna for that specific conversion, and the rule must force the tisraḥ first. He agrees with Hemahaṃsagaṇi that the nyāya does not show anitya behaviour. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri accepts the apavāda labelling but asks whether a separate paribhāṣā is needed. In priyatīsṛṇaḥ, pāṭhakṛta-paratva already places the tisraḥ rule so that it will apply before n āgama. The earlier Haima rule ādeśād āgamaḥ is itself anitya in scope, so it does not block paratva here. He rejects grounding this precedence in a claim that n - āgama is nitya by kṛtākṛta-prasaṅga. If one relied on that path, this rule would not be an apavāda to ādeśād āgamaḥ at all, but an apavāda to parān nityam balavat; and one would still need to argue that āgama is anitya by śabdāntara-prāpti in order to curb the persistence of the earlier effect[cite: 3078, 3079]. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri instead turns to antarāṅga. The tisraḥ sarvādeśa depends only on the numeral base and its initial affix. The nāgama depends on a further condition and so is bahiraṅga. This suffices to set the order even without a new maxim. He then allows the Haima rule as an explanatory aid, not as the primary engine of precedence. His closing position keeps the derivation safe under paratva and antarāṅga and treats āgamāt sarvādeśaḥ as confirmatory. The three treatments differ in where they locate the jñpakā of the rule. Hemahaṃsagaṇi builds a direct jñāpaka from the wording of sutra ṛto raḥ svare ’ni and lets that jñāpaka signal the required sequence. Nandighoṣavijaya anchors the same conclusion in the svādu and vyavadhāyin metarules by restricting the svādu relation to the host relevant to the sarvādeśa. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri reduces the need for a special jñāpaka by pointing to paratva in the chapter order and to antarāṅga as a general regulator. He also uses the accepted idea that āgamas can become anitya when brought by another śabda, which avoids a blanket claim about nityatva as the ground of priority.",
      "historicity": "The earliest mention of this nyāya is in the commentary of Durgasiṃha on the Kaṭantra-sūtras, where he writes it as āgamāt sarvādeśo vidhir balavān. Durgasiṃha applies it to jighatsati related to iṭ āgama, where a complete substitution (sarvādeśa) needs to take precedence over an intervening augment to get the correct form. This was preserved and further commentated upon by Bhavamiśra, another commentator in the Kaṭantra tradition, who repeats the nyāya and applies it to arrive at the correct formation of nirjarsām. Later Bhoja and Haima tradition list it as a separate paribhāṣā in their texts. Hemahaṃsagaṇi integrates it into his Nyāyasaṃgraha. He applies it to the case of priyatris → priyatrisu kulam, where the substitution tisra must precede the n āgama. By including it as part of his ordered sequence of paribhāṣās. Later Haima commentators such as Nandighoṣavijaya and Vijayalāvaṇyasūri discuss its scope and justification, linking it with ṛto raḥ svare ’ni (H 2.1.2) as its jñāpaka. Outside these contexts, the paribhāṣā is not recorded. It is absent from Pāṇinian paribhāṣā treatises such as the Paribhāṣenduśekhara and from the Jainendra, Śākaṭāyana, and Cāndra traditions. This absence shows that the nyāya was not part of the mainstream Pāṇinian or non-Pāṇinian collections.",
      "observation": "The three commentators of Haima tradition differ in how they acepts the nyāya’s authority. Hemahaṃsagaṇi builds his case from the specific wording of ṛto raḥ svare ’ni and lets this act as the signal for the process. Nandighoṣavijaya supports the same order by focusing on svādu and vyavadhāyin metarules, but limits the svādu definition to the relevant host for sarvādeśa. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri minimises the importance of a special signal and shows that the para and antarāṅga rules are enough to achieve the correct outcome. When a substitution replaces the entire base, any later āgama that tries to insert itself depends on an anchor that may be missing if the substitution already happened. In priyatīsṛṇaḥ, if n-āgama came before substitution, the transformation of tri to tisraḥ would either not occur or would be misapplied. Giving priority to substitution ensures the right starting point for further operations. Hemahaṃsagaṇi formalizes this as a specific precedence, while Vijayalāvaṇyasūri reaches the same result through already-existing priority rules. The points of debate among the commentators are universal applicablity and scope. Hemahaṃsagaṇi describes the rule as nitya in its domain and does not suggest any instability. Nandighoṣavijaya agrees and sees the rule as consistent. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri limits its necessity, arguing that established priority rules suffice whenever paratva and antarāṅga are clear. He says that claiming nitya status for n-āgama could create conflicts with other nyāyas, so his approach avoids such issues. The relation to nearby nyayas also matters for keeping the structure coherent. Previous nyāyas emphasised deletion, exception, or handled the interaction between āgama and ādeśa. This nyāya introduces a local precedence that favours substitution over insertion. Hemahaṃsagaṇi presents it as an exception to the previous rule and restricts it to cases of total replacement like tri → tisraḥ.",
      "conclusion": "The paribhāṣā āgamāt sarvādeśaḥ arises from a recurring problem in derivation: if an āgama were applied too early, the expected sarvādeśa could not occur, and the attested forms would be lost. All traditions that preserve this maxim acknowledge this need, but they justify it in different ways. In the Kaṭantra school, Durgasiṃha states it in a general form as āgamāt sarvādeśo vidhir balavān, and later Bhavamiśra echoes the same. Hemahaṃsagaṇi incorporates it into the Haima system as an apavāda to ādeśād āgamaḥ and restricts its scope to cases like priyatrisu. Nandighoṣavijaya makes the rule stronger by relying on the ṛto raḥ svare ’ni jñāpaka to prove that tisra -substitution must come first. The paribhāṣā is not a broad law but a local ordering principle. It ensures that sarvādeśa is not obstructed by āgama in a limited set of derivations. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri questions whether a separate nyāya is needed at all. In his view, the precedence of tisra-ādeśa in priyatrisu can already be explained by the positioning of sūtras (paratva), or by other metarules like parānnityaṃ balavat. He stresses that the jñāpaka Hemahaṃsagaṇi points to (ṛto raḥ svare ’ni) does not unambiguously demand this paribhāṣā. If the rule were necessary, it should have general application, but Hemahaṃsagaṇi himself concedes that it is not universally strong. For Vijayalāvaṇyasūri, this shows that it is not an independent principle but rather a limited adjustment that can be handled within the ordinary framework of precedence.",
      "Meaning and Application": "This nyāya provides a rule for resolving a specific kind of conflict in derivational processes. It applies when both an āgama (an inserted element) and an ādeśa (a substitutive element) want to operate on the same linguistic base. In these cases, the ādeśa must be applied first. The word sarvādeśa in this context has a precise meaning. It refers to a complete replacement of a base element rather than a partial substitution, which is called ekadeśa-ādeśa. Hemahaṃsagaṇi explains this nyāya as an exception to the previous rule, ādeśād āgamaḥ, and demonstrates its function with the example priyatīsṛṇaḥ kulāt. In this example, the numeral stem tri needs to be substituted with tisraḥ. However, an n-āgama also seeks to be introduced at the same point. According to accepted usage, tri first changes to tisraḥ, and only then does n-āgama get applied. This process ensures the correct order of operations and maintains proper derivation. If the n-āgama were applied before the substitution, the final form would not reflect standard usage, and the derivation would target the wrong structure. This justifies the need for the precedence rule. Hemahaṃsagaṇi views this maxim not just as theoretical but as a practical solution for such conflicts."

      "source": "The jñāpaka of this nyāya is seen in the usages like mā bhavān aṭantaṃ prayukta iti mā bhavān aṭiṭat etc., the nitya operation of dvitva of the root is overridden by the anitya operation of hrasva by upāntyasyāsamānalopi śāsvṛdito ṅe (H 4.2.35), which comes first. To indicate this, the root oṇ was marked with ṛdit. If dvitva, being nitya, was bound to occur first by svarāder dvitīyaḥ (6.1.4), then since o is not upāntya, there would be no possibility of hrasva at all, and there would have been no need to mark oṇ with ṛdit to block hrasva. Since ṛdit was in fact marked, it is understood that although dvitva is nitya, hrasva comes first. Yet in mā bhavān aṭiṭat, first hrasva occurs and then dvitva, so the form is obtained. If this nyāya did not exist, then there would have been no need to mark oṇ with ṛdit to show that hrasva comes first, because paratva alone would suffice: hrasva is para, dvitva is pūrva. However, by this maxim, nitya becomes stronger than para. Thus, the nitya dvitva would normally come first, not the anitya upāntya-hrasva. In that case, forms like mā bhavān aṭiṭat would not be obtained. Therefore, to ensure the correctness of such forms, hrasva must precede. To signal this, the root oṇ was marked with ṛdit. Nandighoṣavijaya accepts the nitya-over-para idea but questions Hemahaṃsagaṇi’s jñāpaka. He notes that tv-/m-ādeśa applies for yuṣmad/asmad in the singular, while Hemahaṃsagaṇi’s own vigraha has yuṣmān/asmān (plural). If the singular condition is not met, there is no real competition between tv-/m-ādeśa and y-tva; y-tva simply applies, so the example does not probe the paribhāṣā. He proposes “dīvyati” as a clean case. From div-, the system obtains śya by divādeḥ śyaḥ and guṇa by laghor upāntyasya. Śya is nitya, guṇa is para. On parān nityam, śya goes first; then śid-avit blocks the guṇa, and the dīrgha comes later to give dīvyati. This shows the intended force without the singular/plural complication. On the jñāpaka question, he also argues that the oṇ-ṛdit is not a necessary indicator of a universal nyāya, as one can explain that bahiraṅga/antaraṅga as a way to neutralise an otherwise later hrasva problem by ordinary paratva and case requirements.",
      "historicity": "This paribhāṣā is listed separately for first time in the Bhāvamiśra commentary of Kātantra tradition. Other than Nāgeśa’s Paribhāṣenduśekhara this paribhāṣā is not listed in any of the paribhāṣā text of the Pāṇinian school. Even in non-Pāṇinian paribhāṣā texts, it is accepted as distinct nyāya only in the Haima and Kātantra school. The reason for its absence from most of the paribhāṣā text is because, the nyāya paranityāntaraṅgāpavādānām uttarottaram baliyaḥ already establish the strength of different category of paribhāṣā.",
      "observation": "Vijayalāvaṇyasūri also criticises the jñāpaka given by Hemahaṃsagaṇi. He questions whether a separate paribhāṣā is needed at all. In many cases, paratva and antarāṅga/bahiraṅga already settle the order. He reviews the “mā bhavān aṭiṭat” locus and points out that if upāntyahrasva were truly bahiraṅga and dvitva truly antarāṅga, then antarāṅga would run first, and one would not need a special nyāya to push hrasva ahead. If one instead treats hrasva as bahiraṅga but still wants it first, the oṇ-ṛdit is doing that local work, but that does not by itself generalize to a system-wide paribhāṣā. He also questions Hemahaṃsagaṇi’s “yuṣyā/asyā” case for the same reason as Nandighoṣa: tv-/m-ādeśa presupposes ekavacana, so there is no clash in the plural example. As a sound illustration he too prefers a classical Pāṇinian derivation like “tudati”: śa-pratyaya is nitya; guṇa by laghor upāntyasya is para; the nitya śa goes first, and because of śid-avit guṇa never arises[cite: 3177, 3178, 3179]. That shows parān nityam without auxiliary edits. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri then turns to the status question. He accepts the logic that a nitya process is kṛtākṛta-prasaṅgī (it remains applicable whether its rival has fired or not), and that this gives it effective priority. But he wants careful scoping. He therefore formulates a restriction: the nitya-rule is balavat “when it is not both bahiraṅga and an utsarga”. In other words, do not allow nitya to trample antarāṅga or a specific apavāda. Use it to break ties with a later rival of comparable generality. This keeps parān nityam as a tool for the intended class of competitions and prevents drift into other priority deciding paribhāṣā. Nāgeśa sums up the core rationale in one sentence: “parān nityaṃ balavat, kṛtākṛta-prasaṅgitvāt.” A nitya -rule is strong because it applies before or after the opposing sūtra and thus cannot be neutralised by the that sūtra[cite: 3187, 3188].",
      "conclusion": "All the commentators agree on the functional content that when a nitya and a para rule compete on the same locus and stage, the nitya rule must take effect first. The disagreement is about jñāpaka and its application. Hemahaṃsagaṇi’s yuṣyā/asyā example does not establish a real competition because the ekavacana condition is not present. On the jñāpaka, Hemahaṃsagaṇi reads oṇ-ṛdit as a sign that the tradition needed an anitya hrasva to precede a nitya dvitva, and thus as indirect support for a parānnityam principle. Nandighoṣa and Vijayalāvaṇyasūri answer that this proves only a local priority, not a general rule. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri sets a scope limit so that parān nityam does not override antarāṅga or apavāda rules. The general consensus is that the strength of a rule must be determined by its inherent kṛtākṛta-prasaṅgī nature.",
      "Meaning and Application": "This nyāya is an exception to the Haima sūtra spardhe (7.4.119). Spardhā says that where two different operations are obtained simultaneously from two different sūtras, the operation from the later sūtra (para) is stronger and takes effect first. Hemahaṃsagaṇi limits that by saying that if one of the two is nitya, the nitya -rule goes first even if it is not the later one. He shows the application through the example of yuṣmān asmān vā ācakṣāṇena yuṣyā asyā. Here from yuṣmad and asmad there is attainment ṇic. Then by ṇyantyasvarādeḥ (7.4.43) there will be the lopa of ad. By kvip there will be its lopa through aprayogīt (1.1.37). By ṇeraniti (4.3.83) there will be the lopa of ṇic. Then, when ṭā suffix comes, there will be yuṣm + ā, asm + ā. At that stage by tvamo pratyayottarapade caikasmin (2.1.19) there is the occurrence of tva and ma substitutions, and by ṭāṅyosi yaḥ (2.1.7) there is the y-substitution of m. Between these two operations, the tvam-ādeśa is later, while yatva is earlier but also nitya. For even if the tvam-ādeśa is made first, still by ṭāṅyosi yaḥ the a of tva and ma will take y. Therefore, in the derivations, the m of yuṣmad and asmad undergoes y-substitution before tvam-ādeśa takes effect."

      "source": "Hemahaṃsagaṇi provides the word āśīḥ as a jñāpaka and explains that the vowel lengthening ( dīrgha ) of the base form āśis must occur before the application of visarga, even though the latter is a nitya operation. The justification for this order is that dīrgha, though anitya, is antaranga, while visarga is bahiraṅga. Hemahaṃsagaṇi considers this case sufficient to justify the nyāya and identifies “āśīḥ” as the jñāpaka for this paribhāṣā. He interprets the derivational order based on antarangatva being pūrvavyavasthita and ekapadāśrita. He says the form āśīḥ would only be derivable if the non-obligatory vowel lengthening occurs before the obligatory visarga transformation. Nandighoṣavijaya, in his Hindi commentary, supports Hemahaṃsagaṇi’s identification of āśīḥ as the jñāpaka. He explains that if this paribhāṣā were not operative, then the visarga would apply first (since it is nitya), and the subsequent lack of repha would prevent vowel lengthening, making the form āśīḥ impossible. Therefore, he accepts the form āśīḥ as both the evidence and the justification for the rule nityād antarangaṃ, affirming that this usage in the sūtra functions as the jñāpaka for the paribhāṣā. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri evaluates the logic of applying this paribhāṣā and counters the objection that dīrgha should be considered bahiraṅga due to its multiple dependencies (nimitta, sthānī, padāntatva). He asserts that greater dependency ( adhikāpekṣatva ) does not necessarily imply bahiraṅgatva, as established in the rule asiddhaṃ bahiraṅgam antarange. He further argues that the precedence of antaranga over nitya is already grounded in that prior rule, and no separate jñāpaka is needed. This reflects that in Pāṇini’s framework, nitya is not always the strongest, and antaranga can override it when it is later in order or more immediate in scope.",
      "historicity": "The nyāya nityād antarangaṃ is absent from the Pāṇinian paribhāṣā texts, likely because the same logic is covered by broader principles like “paranityāntaraṅgamapavādānām uttarottaraṃ balīyaḥ”. The Mahābhāṣya and traditional Pāṇinian commentaries handle such cases through layered priority rules rather than isolating nitya and antaranga in binary comparison. The nyāya is, however, preserved and formulated in Haima grammar and non-Pāṇinian systems. Its appearance in the Kalāpa-paribhāṣā (Kaṭantra) and the Jainendra Paribhāṣā (edited by K.V. Abhyankar) shows that the idea was deemed useful for their grammatical system. Thus, while nityād antarangaṃ is not formally part of the Pāṇinian meta-rules, its function is acknowledged and implemented through more composite paribhāṣās that consider multiple hierarchies simultaneously.",
      "observation": "This paribhāṣā raises important questions about how derivational conflicts are resolved when one rule is obligatory (nitya) and another is inner (antaranga). Normally, nitya operations are expected to apply first. But this rule clarifies that antaranga operations, when more internally situated... take priority. The critical point of contention is whether vowel lengthening (dīrgha) qualifies as antaranga despite having multiple dependencies (repha, padāntatva, etc.). Nandighoṣavijaya accepts it based on its prior positioning. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri defends its antarangatva by citing asiddhaṃ bahiraṅgam antarange, which prevents equating greater dependence with outer status. This discussion also shows the influence of formal definitions of antaranga and bahiraṅga in determining derivational order.",
      "conclusion": "The paribhāṣā nityād antarangaṃ establishes a clear principle: in cases of conflict, the internal operation ( antaranga ) must be applied before an obligatory but external ( bahiraṅga ) operation. It reflects a refined understanding of derivational proximity and priority. While the Pāṇinian tradition handles such conflicts under composite meta-rules, the Haima and Kaṭantra grammatical traditions isolate and highlight this rule for clarity. Later commentaries affirm both its necessity and its scope. Commentators differ on whether āśīḥ it truly qualifies as a jñāpaka. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri argues that it is unnecessary to treat it as such, since the principle is already embedded in prior paribhāṣās. This nyāya reinforces the broader grammatical philosophy that derivational proximity, internal dependency, and structure take precedence over mere obligatory rules in application.",
      "Meaning and Application": "This paribhāṣā states that even a non-obligatory antaranga operation takes precedence over a nitya operation. In derivational procedures where a choice must be made between two operations, one nitya, the other antaranga, the latter applies first. Hemahaṃsagaṇi illustrates this with the derivation of forms like prejuḥ → propuḥ. The verbal roots yaj and vap, when combined with the prefix pra and followed by the suffix -us (used in plural anyadartha contexts), undergo multiple changes: (1) vowel modification (etva/otva), which is nitya but depends on two padas (hence bahiraṅga), and (2) vowel lengthening (dīrgha), which is antaranga and based on the same pada but is anitya. According to this nyāya, even though the vowel lengthening is not obligatory, it must apply before the etva/otva transformation due to its antarangatva. The same application is seen in the example āśīḥ from P. 3.3.13, where the lengthening of i precedes the nitya application of visarga due to antarangatva, even though the lengthening is anitya."

      "source": "Hemahaṁsagaṇi states that even though tv- and m-ādeśas are antaranga, they are overridden by the full substitutions tvam and aham due to the principle of anavakāśa. He calls this nyāya necessary to explain the applicability of sūtra 2.1.12 (“tvam ahaṃ sinā prāk cākaḥ”), which would otherwise be pointless if the antaranga substitutions had already been applied. He concludes that there is no arbitrariness in such precedent, and the paribhāṣā itself explains the derivational logic. Nandighoṣavijaya further supports this reading. He treats tv- and m-ādeśas as antaranga and tvam and aham as bahiraṅga, but notes that the latter must be applied due to the anavakāśa of sūtra 2.1.12. He also identifies this sūtra itself as the jñāpaka for the paribhāṣā, arguing that if the antaranga operation had taken place, the sūtra would have no purpose. He considers this paribhāṣā to be nitya. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri explains this rule in relation to yena nāprāpte. He distinguishes anavakāśa from both apavāda and yena nāprāpte by observing that anavakāśa-based overriding depends on the absence of scope, whereas yena nāprāpte allows for overriding even when scope exists. He says that the rule “antarangāc cānavakāśam” is not redundant, as it deals with a different situation from yena nāprāpte. He also points out that in the Pāṇinian tradition, anavakāśa is subsumed under apavāda, and this paribhāṣā does not appear separately. But in the Siddha-Hema system, its independent listing helps highlight a subtle but meaningful difference in rule conflict situations.",
      "historicity": "This paribhāṣā is specific to the Haima grammatical tradition and is not separately attested in the Pāṇinian tradition. In the Aṣṭādhyāyī-based system, rule precedence in similar contexts is governed by composite rules such as “yena nāprāpte yo vidhiḥ”. The concept of anavakāśa is treated as an instance of apavāda or is absorbed under more general overriding principles. Therefore, the specific formulation “antarangāccānavakāśam” is not found in the Pāṇinian paribhāṣā literature. However, in the Siddha-Hema system, this rule is formulated independently to emphasise a unique case where a bahiraṅga operation, though later in derivation, must override an antaranga one due to the complete blocking of its application. This independent status allows the Haima tradition to express derivational control more explicitly, even if the Pāṇinian system handles it through broader logical mechanisms. As Vijayalāvaṇyasūri notes, while the distinction could be collapsed, keeping the rule separate makes the internal logic more transparent.",
      "observation": "This paribhāṣā clarifies a specific exception to the usual hierarchy where antaranga rules override bahiraṅga rules. It introduces the idea that if a rule cannot apply due to another rule already being applied, then it deserves to be prioritized instead. This concept of niravakāśatva reorders the derivational sequence, and the paribhāṣā provides a necessary justification for overriding more immediate operations. Both Hemahaṃsagaṇi and Nandighoṣavijaya agree on the centrality of sūtra H 2.1.12 as the jñāpaka, suggesting that without this paribhāṣā, the sūtra would become invalid or purposeless. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri adds a further comparative analysis by examining how this rule differs from yena nāprāpte. He notes that examples of yena nāprāpte-based overriding are many, while examples based purely on anavakāśa are fewer. He accepts that the rule has its place only because the absence of scope (avakāśābhāva) can itself be a reason to block earlier antaranga operations. This ensures that the application of rules remains consistent with how sūtras are formulated and not just with proximity-based logic.",
      "conclusion": "The paribhāṣā “antarangāc cānavakāśam” plays a specific role in derivational logic by asserting that an operation that becomes niravakāśa must override one that is antaranga. While this seems to contradict the general principle of antaranga-priority, it resolves real derivational conflicts where later rules would otherwise be rendered impossible. The Haima system recognises the need for this exception and treats the rule as independent. The Pāṇinian tradition does not formulate it separately but includes its effect within more general rules. The discussions by Hemahaṃsagaṇi, Nandighoṣavijaya, and Vijayalāvaṇyasūri support the view that anavakāśa can justify overriding antaranga operations. Their analysis also helps clarify the relation between scope, position, and rule hierarchy in Sanskrit grammar.",
      "Meaning and Application": "This paribhāṣā explains that an anavakāśa operation can override an antaranga one, even if the former is bahiraṅga. The rule rests on the principle that if, after an antaranga operation is applied, a later operation becomes impossible to apply (niravakāśa), then that later operation must be given priority. Thus, this paribhāṣā introduces a specific condition where the normal priority of antaranga over bahiraṅga is set aside due to the non-availability of scope (avakāśa-abhāva). The example cited is the derivation of tvam and aham. In forms like yuṣmad + si and asmad + si, according to the rule “tvamo pratyayottarapade ca ekasmin” (H 2.1.91), there is a partial substitution (tv- and m-ādeśa) which is considered antaranga because it only involves a part of the prakṛti. However, if this substitution takes place, then the rule “tvam ahaṃ sinā prāk cākaḥ” (H 2.1.12), which prescribes full-form tvam and aham substitutions and is bahiraṅga, becomes inapplicable. The paribhāṣā states that such niravakāśa (anavakāśa) of the later rule makes it stronger, and therefore, the earlier antaranga operation is blocked."

      "source": "The Haima grammatical source for this paribhāṣā is illustrated by using affix selection between gha (general) and ghañ (exceptional) in compounding. Hemahaṃsagaṇi further explains the role of nipātana to prevent overextension of the apavāda. The jñāpaka, or indirect indicator, for this rule, according to Hemahaṃsagaṇi, is the sūtra 5.3.131, which lists words where ghañ is to be applied. This list shows that if the paribhāṣā were not active, ghañ would have applied more broadly, requiring limitation by a special sūtra. Nandighoṣavijaya also accepts 5.3.131 as the jñāpaka. Additionally, he provides another jñāpaka: the sūtra asarūpo’pavāde votsargaḥ prākkṛteḥ (H 6.1.86). This rule shows that if utsarga were stronger, it would apply even in apavāda’s domain, and that woud make the rule unnecessary. But because such a rule is present, it implies the strength of the apavāda. In Vijayalāvaṇyasūri’s commentary, this paribhāṣā is explained together with antarangāc cānavakāśam, showing that both result in the overriding of a prior rule. He explains that in utsarga-apavāda situations, even if something has already been carried out (i.e., charitārtha), it may still be overridden by a later apavāda. He aligns this rule with the broader meta-rule yena nāprāpte, but shows that utsargād apavādaḥ is a further expansion (prapañca) of that overriding logic, not a mere repetition. Thus, its separate articulation is justified.",
      "historicity": "This paribhāṣā is not found as an independent nyāya in the Pāṇinian paribhāṣā texts. Instead, the concept is assumed within other rules, such as yena nāprāpte yo vidhir ārabhyate sa tasya bādhakaḥ In the Paribhāṣenduśekhara, the rule utsargād apavādaḥ is sometimes listed separately, and sometimes presented as derived from yena nāprāpte. According to Vijayalāvaṇyasūri, some versions of Paribhāṣenduśekhara include the word eva in yena nāprāpte, indicating emphasis on specific override. In the Kaṭantra grammatical tradition, the rule appears in a similar form: “utsargāpavādayor apavādavidhir balavān”. This expresses the same idea that the apavāda-vidhi is stronger than the utsarga-vidhi, which shows that this nyāya was already accepted separately in earlier paribhāṣā texts of non-pāṇinian tradition. According to Nandighoṣa, this rule is not found in the Pāṇinian, Śākalāyana, or Cāndra paribhāṣā traditions in explicit form. However, the rule apavādāt kvavicchid utsargo’pi is cited as the basis for this paribhāṣā’s conceptual presence in the Pāṇinian system. Because apavāda is treated as viśeṣa-śāstra, and utsarga as sāmānya-śāstra, the principle that viśeṣa overrides sāmānya is well-established, even if not formally stated.",
      "observation": "The role of this paribhāṣā is to maintain the precision in derivation. It is a balābala paribhāṣā. Its main contribution is ensuring that specific conditions are not ignored simply because a general rule is also applicable. It safeguards against the overextension of general rules by creating a logical hierarchy, where exceptions when applicable must be preferred. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri notes that even when the derivational process under the general rule is already complete, the exception can override it. This distinguishes it from the anavakāśa-based override (which applies only when a later rule blocks the application of an earlier one before it takes place). Therefore, while both lead to override, their mechanisms differ. The inclusion of this rule as an independent paribhāṣā in the Siddha-Hema tradition allows finer control over such distinctions, unlike the Pāṇinian tradition, which tends to include anavakāśa logic within apavāda.",
      "conclusion": "The paribhāṣā utsargād apavādaḥ establishes the priority of specific rules over general ones. Its application is supported universally by how sūtra operate in different traditions. Although it is not listed independently in all traditions, the concept is universally accepted. The Haima tradition treats it as a distinct and necessary to distinguish its logic from related principles like yena nāprāpte or to show difference between apvāda and anavakāśa. This separation makes the analysis of derivational conflicts easier and also maintains the precision of grammatical operation.",
      "Meaning and Application": "This paribhāṣā states that an apavāda (exception) overrides a utsarga (general rule). The primary idea is that where both a general and a specific rule are applicable, the specific rule is to be applied, and the general rule becomes inapplicable. Hemahaṃsagaṇi gives the example of the affix ghañ being stronger than the general affix gha. In the derivation āpacanti asmin iti pākaḥ, the general rule is puṁnāmni ghaḥ (H 5.3.130), but the exceptional rule vyañjanād ghañ (H 5.3.131) applies due to its specificity. The affix ghañ is applied instead of gha. Hemahaṃsagaṇi adds that the nipātana of words like gocara, sañcara, vaha, etc., in H 5.3.131 is meant to prevent the unintended application of ghañ elsewhere, since otherwise, this paribhāṣā would override the general rule and make ghañ universally applicable. Therefore, the sūtra was created to limit the application of the exception. Nandighoṣa similarly explains that the affix ghañ is used and not gha, due to the force of the apavāda rule. He cites the nipātana list in the sūtra gocara-saṃcara-vaha-braja-vyaja-khalāpaṇa-nigama-baka-bhaga-kaṣā-kaṣa-nikaṣam (5.3.131) as the jñāpaka of the paribhāṣā. He notes that if this nipātana did not exist, then by this paribhāṣā, the general gha would have been overridden, and ghañ would be applied by default. Thus, the application of this paribhāṣā makes it clear that in any derivational context where an apavāda exists, it must take precedence over the utsarga."

Hemahaṃsagaṇi clarifies that no other effort is made to justify these forms, hence that itself should be considered as the jñāpaka of this nyāya. Nandighoṣavijaya supports this reading and identifies the jñāpaka as the usage of words like makha and maṭha in standard language without the expected suffix from the apavāda rule. He also notes that this paribhāṣā is of nitya-svabhāva, meaning it is universally applicable. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri clarifies that the word apavāda here refers to the bādhaka (the overriding rule). He also connects this paribhāṣā to the parallel in the Pāṇinian tradition: “kvacid apavādaviṣaye’py utsargo’bhiniviśate”, suggesting both aim to express the same idea that even in a situation governed by an apavāda, the utsarga may apply. Nāgeśa Bhaṭṭa, in the Paribhāṣenduśekhara, discusses various examples showing how such a situation can be logically understood. He cites the Mahābhāṣya on 7.4.82 and 1.2.9, where anavakāśatva (lack of scope) is used as a reason for allowing the general rule to prevail. He emphasises that when a prior rule has already exhausted the scope for the apavāda to operate, the utsarga naturally applies. Śīradeva also gives examples from 4.3.144 and 4.3.140 (like kāñcanī vāsayaṣṭiḥ) and from 4.1.83 (prāg dīvyato’ṇ) to show how this paribhāṣā helps explain why an utsarga (like añ) applies even when an apavāda like mayaṭ or iñ exists.

Although not present in Vyāḍi paribhāṣāsūcana, later paribhāṣā texts of Sīradeva and Puruṣottama discuss it at length. The nyāya is absent from the Śākaṭāyana and Cāndra traditions.

Hence, the phrase kvacit is important it signals limited applicability. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri stresses that this paribhāṣā should not be misunderstood as weakening the general apavāda-utsarga framework. He adds that when an apavāda has already been bypassed or neutralized (e.g., due to bādha-anupapatti), the utsarga comes in to maintain order. Nāgeśa further explains that an anavakāśatva-based override is acceptable only when the prior apavāda has already been satisfied or is inapplicable, thereby allowing a return to the utsarga. Śīradeva, too, insists that these cases must be viewed case by case, as in examples involving suffix selection (mayaṭ, iñ, añ) or compound construction, where context and kriyā-relations guide the rule preference.",
      "conclusion": "The paribhāṣā, “apavādāt kvacid utsargo’pi,” describes a rare but necessary situation where the general rule asserts itself even when an exception is present. This is not a contradiction of the general rule-exception hierarchy, but a clarification that in cases where the exception has no effect due to context or usage, the general rule reclaims its applicability. This paribhāṣā ensures that the derivational system can account for forms that do not follow expected exception-based derivations, such as makha, maṭha, without invoking further arbitrary mechanisms. It preserves grammatical consistency by showing that the system allows controlled reversals of rule hierarchy based on scope and context. The paribhāṣā is accepted in the Haima system, and it also has its parallel in the Pāṇinian system about the occasional reassertion of utsarga.",
      "Meaning and Application": "This paribhāṣā states that in some specific contexts, the utsarga (general rule) can prevail even over the apavāda (exception). Normally, an apavāda overrides its utsarga due to its greater specificity. But here, it is accepted that in certain instances, utsarga is applicable and the effect of the apavāda is negated by its application. The example is seen in the derivation of words like makha (ritual sacrifice) and maṭha (monastery). In both cases, the general rule “puṁnāmni ghaḥ” (H 5.3.130) would prescribe the suffix gha, but there exists an apavāda in the form of “vyañjanād ghañ” (H 5.3.132). If the apavāda prevailed, the suffix would be ghañ, giving rise to forms like mākha, māṭha, etc. However, in usage, the forms makha, maṭha are found, which clearly follow the general rule ghaḥ. This suggests that the apavāda rule is suppressed, and the utsarga is applied instead. Thus, this paribhāṣā justifies such usages where, despite the presence of a more specific apavāda rule, the derivation follows the general utsarga rule. This rule is invoked to account for such derivations without requiring additional explanation."

      "source": "In the Haima system, Hemahaṃsagaṇi gives several illustrations. He shows that although phalavat-kartṛ could generate ātmanepada by general rules, the sūtra kartṛ-sthāmūrtāpyāt is introduced as a niyama to restrict it. The jñāpaka here is the absence of an explicit qualifier in the sūtra. Similarly, in lopāt svarādeśaḥ, the absence of an explicit clause like “dīrgha-varjaḥ svarādeśaḥ” is treated as a jñāpaka. This indicates that the nyāya operates to block aniṣṭa forms. He concludes that this nyāya is not absolute (anātyantika) and cites the sūtra idam adaso’k eva (1.4.3) to show that the eva particle was required to remove an aniṣṭa-niyama. If the nyāya were absolute, such a particle would not have been necessary. Nandighoṣavijaya follows the same examples but develops them in more detail. He explicitly identifies the omission of specific qualifiers as the jñāpaka of this nyāya. For cikīrṣyate, he shows the steps (kyaḥ śiti, san, cvi, dīrgha) that could wrongly generate cikīrṣāyate, and explains that the nyāya prevents this. He also extends the discussion to śrī-ādinātha, where expected ī → yv does not occur, and the absence is justified by śiṣṭa-consent through this nyāya. Further, he connects this principle to the sūtra lokāt (1.1.23) in Siddha-Hema, showing that the reach of śāstra includes Sanskrit and other languages such as Prākṛt, Māgadhī, Śaurasenī, Paiśācī, Cūlikā-Paiśācī, and Apabhraṁśa, but always conditioned by accepted usage. He also cites Bhoja Vyākaraṇa and Kaṭantra (Bhāva-miśra) where a similar principle is expressed: “yallakṣaṇenānupapannaṁ tatsarvaṁ nipātanāt siddham.” Vijayalāvaṇyasūri also begins with the general principle that śāstra is pervaded by utsarga and apavāda, but is not absolute in scope. He cites siddhiḥ syād-vādataḥ to demonstrate this. He compares the paribhāṣā with the Bhāṣya statement yathā-lakṣaṇam aprayukte, which he interprets in two ways: either lakṣaṇa still applies to aprayukta-śabda, or lakṣaṇa does not apply to aprayukta at all. In the second interpretation, aprayukta means aniṣṭa, so śāstra does not apply there. He thus supports the same outcome as Hemahaṃsagaṇi but disagrees with him on the anityatva of the nyāya. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri argues that eva in idam adaso’k eva is for niyama-bodhana, not to show anityatva of the nyāya. He even suggests an alternative explanation through the nyāsa nedamasor aki where the meaning is managed without weakening the nyāya. Thus, while Hemahaṃsagaṇi uses ak-evā to prove the impermanence of this paribhāṣā, both Nandighoṣavijaya and Vijayalāvaṇyasūri maintain that the paribhāṣā remains consistent and the eva is only to clarify the desired niyama.",
      "historicity": "This nyāya is attested in multiple grammatical traditions. It is explicitly present in the Haima tradition as given in Nyāyasaṃgraha. In the Pāṇinian tradition, the Mahābhāṣya contains discussions equivalent to it, though not formulated as a separate paribhāṣā. The Bhāṣya at yathā-lakṣaṇam aprayukte hints at the same principle. Nageśa in Paribhāṣenduśekhara also discusses its relation with yena nāprāpte. He shows that both general override (vādhya-sāmānya-cintā) and specific override (vādhya-viśeṣa-cintā) are possible, but in aniṣṭa contexts the examples are limited, making this nyāya distinct. Bhoja Vyākaraṇa and Kaṭantra’s Paribhāṣā-vṛtti of Bhāva-miśra also record similar formulations. In Siddha-Hema, it is given its own place as a separate paribhāṣā.",
      "observation": "The paribhāṣā shows the regulative role of śāstra. It is not enough to have sūtra rules; the function of śāstra is restricted to ensuring forms that are accepted in śiṣṭa usage. Hemahaṃsagaṇi’s emphasis is on blocking aniṣṭa derivations by interpreting rules with implied restrictions and treating omissions as jñāpaka. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri broadens the scope by placing this within the larger framework of utsarga and apavāda, and clarifies that the principle is not anitya. Nandighoṣavijaya adds clarity by working through detailed derivations such as cikīrṣyate, and by explicitly stating that unspoken qualifiers are the jñāpaka of this nyāya. He also highlights how the Siddha-Hema extends the principle across Sanskrit and Prākṛt systems. The difference between Hemahaṃsagaṇi and the later commentators lies in the interpretation of ak-evā. Hemahaṃsagaṇi sees it as evidence for the non-absoluteness of the nyāya. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri and Nandighoṣavijaya deny this, holding that the nyāya is not weakened and that eva is only to clarify the desired niyama. This shows a shift in interpretative strategy: while Hemahaṃsagaṇi derives anityatva from textual evidence, later commentators preserve the authority of the paribhāṣā and assign eva a more limited explanatory function.",
      "conclusion": "The paribhāṣā is there to ensures that grammatical rules are applied only for desired forms sanctioned by usage and not for aniṣṭa outcomes. Hemahaṃsagaṇi demonstrates this with examples from nī and cikīrṣyate, grounding the principle in unspoken qualifiers and treating it as non-absolute. Vijayalāvaṇyasūri, however, insists that the nyāya is not anitya and should not be weakened by the interpretation of ak-evā. Nandighoṣavijaya reinforces this position with detailed procedural examples and wider cross-linguistic application. Together, the discussions across these commentators show how this paribhāṣā regulates the śāstra by aligning its operation with accepted practice and excluding the possibility of aniṣṭa derivations.",
      "Meaning and Application": "This paribhāṣā states that the function of śāstra is not for the derivation of aniṣṭa (undesired) forms or meanings. Śāstra, whether in the form of sūtra or nyāya, operates only to establish śiṣṭa-prayoga. It prohibits the derivation of undesirable or unaccepted forms. For example, in the case of the root nī, though ī-gitaḥ (3.3.95) allows ātmanepada in the sense of phalavat-kartṛ, still P. 3.3.40 kartṛ-sthāmūrtāpyāt restricts it. The restriction is that only when the object is in the agent and is amūrta (intangible) does ātmanepada apply. Otherwise, even when there is phalavat-kartṛ, ātmanepada does not apply. Thus, in usages like caitrasya manyuṁ vinayati or gaḍuṁ vinayati, only parasmaipada occurs. Another application is in cikīrṣyate. The form could lead to cikīrṣāyate if the nyāya lopāt svarādeśaḥ were applied along with cvi and dīrgha. But since the form cikīrṣāyate is aniṣṭa, the nyāya does not extend to it. Instead, the intended form cikīrṣyate is retained. In general, the nyāya functions to prevent over-application of rules which would produce non-accepted forms."
